effect for the 2022 NFL season. Member clubs of the League may amend the rules from time to time, pursuant to the applicable voting procedures of the NFL Constitution and Bylaws.  Any intra-League dispute or call for interpretation in connection with these rules will be decided by the Commissioner of the League, whose ruling will be final.  Because inter-conference games are played throughout the preseason, regular season, and postseason in the NFL, all rules contained in this book apply uniformly to both the American and National Football Conferences.  Where the word \u201cillegal\u201d appears in this rule book, it is an institutional term of art pertaining strictly to actions that violate NFL playing rules. It is not meant to connote illegality under any public law or the rules or regulations of any other organization.  The word \u201cflagrant,\u201d when used here to describe an action by a player, is meant to indicate that the degree of a violation of the rules\u2014usually a personal foul or unnecessary roughness\u2014is extremely objectionable, conspicuous, unnecessary, avoidable, or gratuitous. \u201cFlagrant\u201d in these rules does not necessarily imply malice on the part of the fouling player or an intention to injure an opponent.

The playing field will be rimmed by a solid white border six feet wide along the end lines and sidelines. There will be an additional broken yellow line nine feet farther outside this border along each sideline in the non-bench areas, and such broken line will be continued at an angle from each 25-yard line and pass behind the bench area (all benches a minimum of 30 feet back from the sidelines) at a distance of six feet. In each end zone, this broken yellow line is six feet from the solid white border. These yellow broken lines are to be eight inches wide and two feet long with a space of one foot between them.In addition, within each bench area, a solid yellow line six feet behind  the solid border will delineate a special area for coaches, behind which all players, except one player who is charting the game, must remain. Furthermore, a broken white line four inches wide and four feet long with a space of two-foot intervals will be marked three feet inside the nine-foot restriction line on the sideline, extending to meet the existing yellow broken line six feet behind both end zones and at each television box outside the bench area.2. All lines are to be four inches wide, with the exception of the goal line and yellow lines, which are to be eight inches wide. Tolerance of line widths is plus one-fourth inch.3. All line work is to be laid out to dimensions shown on the plan with a tolerance of plus one-fourth inch. All lines are straight.4. All boundary lines, goal lines, and marked yard lines are to be continuous lines.5. The four intersections of goal lines and sidelines must be marked at inside corners of the end zone and the goal line by pylons. Pylons must be placed at inside edges of white lines and should not touch the surface of the actual playing field itself.6. All lines are to be marked with a material that is not injurious to eyes or skin.7. No benches or rigid fixtures should be nearer than 1O yards from the sidelines. If space permits, they may be further back.8. Player benches can be situated anywhere between respective 30-yard lines. Where possible, a continuation of the dotted yellow line is to extend from the25-yard lines to a point six feet behind the player benches thereby enclosing this area.9. A white arrow is to be placed on the ground adjacent to the top portion of each number (with the exception of the 50) with the point formed by the two longer sides pointing toward the goal line. The two longer sides measure 36 inches each, while the  side measures 18 inches. The 18-inch crossfield side is to start 15 inches below the top, and 6 inches from the goalward edge of each outer number (except the 50).10.  The location of the inbounds lines is 70\u20199\u201d for professional football, 60\u20190\u201d for college football. On fields used primarily by the NFL, the professional inbounds lines should be 4 inches wide by 2 feet long.

PLAYING LINES. The game shall be played upon a rectangular field, 360 feet in length and 160 feet in width. The lines at each end of the field are termed End Lines. Those on each side are termed Sidelines. Goal Lines shall be established in the field 10 yards from and parallel to each end line. The area bounded by goal lines and sidelines is known as the Field of Play. The surface of the entire Field of Play must be a League-approved shade of green. The areas bounded by goal lines, end lines, and sidelines are known as the End Zones.  The areas bounded by goal lines and lines parallel to, and 70 feet 9 inches inbounds, from each sideline, are known as the Side Zones. The lines parallel to sidelines are termed Inbound Lines. The end lines and the sidelines are also termed Boundary Lines.  ARTICLE 2.  FIELD.  The Field includes the Field of Play and the End Zones. The Field will be rimmed by a solid white border a minimum of 6 feet wide along the end lines and sidelines. An additional broken limit line 6 feet further outside this border is to encompass the Field in the non-bench areas, and such broken line will be continued at an angle from each 25-yard line and pass behind the bench areas (all benches a minimum 30 feet back from the sidelines). In addition, within each bench area, a yellow line 6 feet behind the solid white border will delineate a special area for coaches, behind which all players, except one player charting the game, must remain. If a club\u2019s solid white border is a minimum of 12 feet wide, there is no requirement that the broken restraining line also be added in the non-bench areas. However, the appropriate yellow line described above must be clearly marked within the bench areas.  In special circumstances (for example, an artificial surface in a multi-purpose stadium) and subject to prior approval from the League Office, a club may omit the 6-foot solid white border during the preseason or later period while football overlaps with another sport, and substitute a single 4-inch white line at what normally would be the outer limit of the solid border (6 feet from the sidelines).  SECTION 2  MARKINGS ARTICLE 1.  LINE MARKINGS. At intervals of 5 yards, yard lines (3-12-9) parallel to the goal lines shall be marked in the field of play. These lines are to stop 8 inches short of the 6-foot solid border. The 4-inch wide yard lines are to be extended 4 inches beyond the white 6-foot border along the sidelines. Each of these lines shall be intersected at right angles by short lines 70 feet, 9 inches long (23 yards, 1 foot, 9 inches) in from each side to indicate inbound lines.  ARTICLE 2.  INBOUND LINES. In line with the Inbound Lines there shall be marks at 1-yard intervals between each distance of 5 yards for the full length of the field. These lines are to begin 8 inches from the 6-foot solid border and are to measure 2 feet in length.  Bottoms of numbers indicating yard lines in multiples of 10 must be placed beginning 12 yards in from each sideline. These are to be 2 yards in length.  Two yards from the middle of each goal line and parallel to it, there shall be marked in the Field of Play, lines 1 yard in length. All boundary lines, goal lines, and marked lines are to be continuous lines. These, and any other specified markings, must be in white, and there shall be no exceptions without the authorization of the Commissioner. Field numerals must also be white.  Care must be exercised in any end-zone marking or decoration or club identification at the 50-yard line that said marking or decorations do not in any way cause confusion as to delineation of goal lines, sidelines, and end lines. Such markings or decorations must be approved by the Commissioner.  The four intersections of goal lines and sidelines must be marked, at inside corners, by weighted pylons. In addition, two such pylons shall be placed on each end line (four in all).  ARTICLE 3.  GOAL LINE. All measurements are to be made from the inside edges of the line marking the boundary lines. Each goal line marking is to be in its end zone so that the edge of the line toward the field of play (actual goal line) is 30 feet from the inside edge of the end line.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4257, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e7c3109-8a1f-4805-991c-2275dc86ba51": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e7c3109-8a1f-4805-991c-2275dc86ba51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67900ca6-b7a9-46ac-9403-64bf13fd711a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "4525212681df3c5d786960fd9c5b883740ed853f5293079e0a5140a7707c12d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "17465e4e-204a-4fce-b73b-4f39318edb25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "d95a5bada18c537ccf69d8233b3cf3751fef3f32aa01329009ed5c4d22e4a39f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "80c5e846-b5b7-4727-b680-1c95ad349b4e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fb3ec5b6b17428fd03ac036d720fc65dceddcdcf3a6822e04e2ed1d2554fdf1f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Field numerals must also be white.

Each goal line is to be eight inches wide.  All lines are to be marked with a material that is not injurious to eyes or skin. It is desirable that the yard line markers be flexible in order to prevent injury. No benches or rigid fixtures should be nearer than 10 yards from sidelines.  ARTICLE 4.  GROUND RULES. In League parks where ground rules are necessary, because of fixed conditions that cannot be changed, they will be made by the Commissioner.   SECTION 3 GOAL ARTICLE 1.  CROSSBAR. In the plane of each end line, there shall be a centrally placed horizontal crossbar 18 feet, 6 inches in length, the top face of which is 10 feet above the ground. The goal is the vertical plane extending indefinitely above the crossbar and between the lines indicated by the outer edges of the goal posts.  ARTICLE 2.  GOAL POSTS.

The uprights will extend 35 feet above the crossbar and will be no less than 3 inches and no more than 4 inches in diameter. An orange-colored ribbon 4 inches by 42 inches is to be attached to the top of each post.  Note: Goal posts must be padded in a manner prescribed by the League.  SECTION 4 PLAYERS\u2019 BENCHES At the option of the home team, both the players\u2019 benches may be located on the same side of the field.

The ball shall be made up of an inflated (12\u00bd to 13\u00bd pounds) urethane bladder enclosed in a pebble grained, leather case (natural tan color) without corrugations of any kind. It shall have the form of a prolate spheroid and the size and weight shall be: long axis, 11 to 11\u00bc inches; long circumference, 28 to 28\u00bd inches; short circumference, 21 to 21\u00bc inches; weight, 14 to 15 ounces.  The Referee shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications. A pump is to be furnished by the home club, and the balls shall remain under the supervision of the Referee until they are delivered to the ball attendant just prior to the start of the game.  SECTION 2 SUPPLY Each team will make 12 primary and 12 backup balls available for testing by the Referee no later than two hours and 30 minutes prior to the starting time of the game to meet League requirements. For all games, six new footballs, sealed in a special box and shipped by the manufacturer to the Referee, will be opened in the officials\u2019 locker room two hours and 15 minutes prior to the starting time of the game. These balls are to be specially marked by the Referee and used exclusively for the kicking game.   In the event a home team ball does not conform to specifications, or its supply is exhausted, the Referee shall secure a proper ball from the visitors and, failing that, use the best available ball. Any such circumstances must be reported to the Commissioner.  In case of rain or a wet, muddy, or slippery field, a playable ball shall be used at the request of the offensive team\u2019s center.  The Game Clock shall not stop for such action (unless undue delay occurs).  Note: It is the responsibility of the home team to furnish playable balls at all times by attendants from either side of the playing field.  \n3", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1983, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3516640-2728-43b0-ab28-8ef3e61b8227": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3516640-2728-43b0-ab28-8ef3e61b8227", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4075bd3f-4ef8-4bda-8e77-be57a1813689", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "b0cc3191e40ad7c10b5ca7daaea7ba4524bd229c606d8b83db1bce704b2e52c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa6965d2-27fd-47b7-bd7a-abfe68663b03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "241a266d81a159370895e074d3131978f5223ed85ed3d94de6e0b04e8fadd26f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b590d56-e524-47be-986b-c21de2a10abe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff34697c69c6f9e10fe61ca4b75952b84e9708c375f95ee50169f5e2dae796fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "RULE 3 DEFINITIONS  SECTION 1 APPROVED RULING (A.R.) An Approved Ruling (A.R.) is a written decision on a given statement of facts and serves to illustrate the intent and application of a rule. Supplemental notes are used to amplify a rule. A Note is more specific and applies to a particular situation. It is also used to indicate pertinent references to other rules.   An Official Ruling (O.R.) is a ruling made in the interim between the annual rules meetings and is official only during the current season.  Technical Terms are such terms that have a fixed and defined meaning throughout the Playing Rules. Because of their alphabetical arrangement in Rule 3, certain ones are used prior to being defined. In such cases, they appear in bold type only the first time they are used.   SECTION 2 THE BALL AND POSSESSION OF THE BALL ARTICLE 1.  DEAD BALL. A Dead Ball is one that is not in play. The time period during which the ball is dead is Between Downs. This includes the interval during all timeouts, including intermission, and from the time the ball becomes dead until it is legally put in play.  ARTICLE 2.  BALL READY FOR PLAY. A Dead Ball is Ready for Play while the 40-second Play Clock is running when the ball is placed down by an official at the spot where the ball will next be put in play, or when the Referee signals for the 25-second Play Clock to start.  ARTICLE 3.  LIVE BALL. A Live Ball is a ball that is in play. A Dead Ball becomes a live ball when it is: (a)  legally kicked on a Free Kick Down (6-1-1; 6-1-3); (b) legally snapped on a Scrimmage Down (7-1-1; 7-3-6); or (c) legally kicked on a Fair Catch Kick Down.  It continues in play until the down ends (3-9-1).  ARTICLE 4.  LOOSE BALL. A Loose Ball is a live ball that is not in player possession, i.e., any ball that has been kicked, passed, or fumbled. A Loose Ball is considered to be in possession of the team (offense) whose player kicked, passed, or fumbled it. It is a Loose Ball until a player secures possession or until the ball becomes dead. If it has not yet struck the ground, a Loose Ball is In Flight.  ARTICLE 5.  FUMBLE. A Fumble is any act, other than passing, successful handing, or legally kicking the ball, which results in a loss of player possession. It is not a fumble if the player immediately regains control of the ball. The use of the term Fumble always means that the ball was in possession of a player when the act occurred (8-7-3).  Note: An intentional fumble that causes the ball to go forward is a forward pass and may be illegal (8-1-1-Pen. a\u2013c).  ARTICLE 6.  MUFF. A Muff is the touching of a loose ball by a player in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession of it.  Note: Any ball intentionally muffed forward is a bat and may be a foul (3-3; 12-5-1; 3-15).  Touching the Ball refers to any contact with the ball. There is no distinction between a player touching the ball with his hands, or with any other part of his body, including his hair, except as specifically provided for (9-2-2).  Note: The result of the touching is sometimes influenced by the intent or the location.  (a) See 6-1-4 and 6-2-4 for touching a free kick. (b) See 6-2-3 for touching a free kick before it goes out of bounds between the goal lines. (c) See 8-1-8 for ineligible offensive player touching a forward pass on, behind, or beyond the line. (d) See 9-2-1, 9-3-1 for touching a scrimmage kick on or behind the line, and also 9-2-4 for being pushed into a kick by an opponent. (e) See 11-4-2 for touching a kick during an attempted field goal. (f) Simultaneous touching by two opponents in an attempt to establish possession of a ball that has been kicked is treated as a first touch by the kicking team.  ARTICLE 7.

(f) Simultaneous touching by two opponents in an attempt to establish possession of a ball that has been kicked is treated as a first touch by the kicking team.  ARTICLE 7.  PLAYER POSSESSION.  A player is in possession when he is inbounds and has control of the ball with his hands or arms.  To gain possession of a loose ball that has been caught, intercepted, or recovered, a player (a) must have complete control of the ball with his hands or arms and (b) have both feet or any other part of his body, other than his hands, completely on the ground inbounds, and, after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, perform any act common to the game (e.g., tuck the ball away, extend it forward, take an additional step, turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent). It is not necessary that he commit such an act, provided that he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so. This rule applies in the field of play, at the sideline, and in the end zone.  Notes: (1)  Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control. (2)  If a player who has completed the first two, but not the third requirement for possession, contacts the ground and loses control of the ball, there is no possession if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out of bounds. If a player would have caught, intercepted, or recovered a ball inbounds, but is carried out of bounds, player possession will be granted (8-1-3-Note 5).  The terms catch, intercept, recover, advance, and fumble denote player possession (as distinguished from touching or muffing).  4", "start_char_idx": 3105, "end_char_idx": 5140, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d84ce1f-aa0a-41d3-b9c9-0af570b04962": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d84ce1f-aa0a-41d3-b9c9-0af570b04962", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d4eb8730-5c49-4357-a820-418b2a9d3299", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "e627c6d68fb575c3fd9934b292adebf24fb7dc6536af91fdef99a8a12dcecece", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b590d56-e524-47be-986b-c21de2a10abe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "041a5c089adc7fe912620c1cda3abbf6ba1b9f5bb220c7892b2c0e0802f9b77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "18248b53-5186-4042-93b9-031c18c90948", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62f16372c29dc11b5a92ebb230c297bd2e43d7ffeb793becd983e63a7f4961a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rule 3 A catch is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a pass, kick, or fumble that is in flight. An interception is made when an opponent who is inbounds catches a forward or backward pass or a fumble that has not touched the ground.  Notes: (1)  It is a catch, or an interception, if, in the process of attempting to possess the ball, a player secures control of the ball prior to it touching the ground, and that control is maintained during and after the ball has touched the ground. (2)  In the field of play, if a catch or interception has been completed, and the ball comes loose before the player is down by contact, it is a fumble, and the ball remains alive. It is also a fumble if the action occurs in the end zone of the player who caught the loose ball. If the action occurs in the opponent\u2019s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback. (3) If there is any question by the covering official(s) as to whether a forward pass is complete, intercepted, or incomplete, it always will be ruled incomplete.  A recovery is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a loose ball after it has touched the ground.  If a Loose Ball is controlled simultaneously by two opponents, and both players retain it, it is simultaneous possession, and the ball belongs to the team last in possession, or to the receiving team when there has been a Free Kick, Scrimmage Kick, or Fair Catch Kick. It is not simultaneous possession if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control.  SECTION 3 BAT A Bat is the intentional striking of the ball with any part of the hand or arm. See 12-5-1.  SECTION 4 BLOCKING Blocking is the act of obstructing or impeding an opponent by contacting him with a part of the blocker\u2019s body.   A Block in the Back is a block that is delivered from behind an opponent above his waist. It is not a block in the back:  (a) if a player is making a personal attempt to recover a loose ball;  (b) if the opponent turns away from the blocker when contact is imminent; (c) if both of the blocker\u2019s hands are on the opponent\u2019s side. (If either hand is on the back, it is a foul.)  A Block Below the Waist is when the initial contact with any part of the blocker\u2019s body is below the waist of an opponent, other than the runner, who has one or both feet on the ground. A blocker who makes contact above the waist and then slides below the waist has not blocked below the waist. If an opponent uses his hands to ward off a block creating contact below the waist, it is not a block below the waist.  SECTION 5 CHUCKING Chucking is intentionally contacting an eligible receiver who is in front of a defender. (See 12-1-5-d-exc. 1).  SECTION 6 CLIPPING Clipping is blocking an opponent from behind below the waist, provided the opponent is not a runner. It is not clipping if an opponent turns his back as the block is delivered or about to be delivered.  Notes: (1) It is clipping (including in close-line play) if an offensive player\u2019s block (legal or illegal) is followed by the blocker rolling up on the side or back of the legs of the defender. (2) See 12-2-1 for additional interpretations or restrictions concerning clipping in close-line play.  SECTION 7  CLOSE-LINE PLAY Close-Line Play is contact that occurs in an area extending between the outside edges of the normal tackle positions and three yards on either side of the line of scrimmage.  SECTION 8 DISQUALIFIED PLAYER A Disqualified Player is one who is prohibited from further participation in the game. He must return to his dressing room within a reasonable period of time and is not permitted to reappear in his team uniform or return to any area other than to which spectators have access.  SECTION 9 DOWN ARTICLE 1.  DOWN. A Down is a period of action that starts when the ball is put in play (3-2-3) and ends when the ball is declared dead (7-2-1).

SECTION 15 HANDING THE BALL Handing the ball is transferring player possession from one teammate to another without passing or kicking it.  (a) Except where permitted by rule, handing the ball forward to a teammate is illegal. (b) Loss of player possession by unsuccessful execution of attempted handing is a fumble charged to the player that last had possession. A muffed handoff (legal or illegal) is a fumble, unless either player immediately regains control of the ball, and the ball remains alive. (c) A forward handoff occurs when the ball is handed (regardless of the direction of the movement of the ball) to a player who is in advance of a teammate from whose hands he takes or receives it.  SECTION 16 HUDDLE A Huddle is the action of two or more players in the field of play or in the end zone who, instead of assuming their normal position for the snap, free kick, or Fair Catch kick form a group for receiving instructions for the next play or for any other reason.  SECTION 17 IMPETUS Impetus is the action of a player who carries the ball or provides the force (i.e., a pass, kick, snap, or fumble) that causes a ball in the field of play to touch or cross a goal line. If a Loose Ball touches or crosses a goal line, the impetus is attributed to the team whose player passed, kicked, snapped, or fumbled the ball, unless an opponent:   (a) muffs a ball that is at rest, or nearly at rest; (b) bats a ball that has been kicked or fumbled; (c) bats a backward pass after it has struck the ground; or (d) illegally kicks any ball (see 12-5-2).  Note: (1) The impetus is always attributed to the offense, unless the defense creates a new force that sends the ball behind its own goal line by muffing a ball which is at rest or nearly at rest, or by batting a loose ball on the ground or kicking any loose ball. (2) If a passive player is pushed or blocked into any kicked or fumbled ball or into a backward pass after it has struck the ground, causing the Loose Ball to touch a goal line or anything on or behind a goal line, the impetus is attributed to the pusher or blocker, provided that the pushed (blocked) player was not making an attempt to block an opponent.

Contact by Team B Player. If contact by an opponent materially affects a passer after the passer begins his throwing motion, it is a forward pass if he passes the ball, regardless of where the ball strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else. When this occurs, intentional grounding rules do not apply.  When a passer is contacted by an opponent before beginning his throwing motion, the direction of the pass is the responsibility of the passer, and intentional grounding rules apply.  Item 2. Passer Tucks Ball. If the player loses possession of the ball during an attempt to bring it back toward his body, or if the player loses possession after he has tucked the ball into his body, it is a fumble.   Item 3. Passer re-cocks his arm. If the player loses possession of the ball while attempting to re-cock his arm, it is a fumble.  Item 4. Fumbled or Muffed Ball Goes Forward. The fact that a fumbled or muffed ball goes forward is disregarded, unless the act is ruled intentional. If it is intentional, a fumbled ball that goes forward is a forward pass (8-1-1), and a muff is a bat (12-5-1).  ARTICLE 5.  BACKWARD PASS. It is a Backward Pass if the yard line at which the ball is first touched by a player or the ground is parallel to or behind the yard line at which the ball leaves the passer\u2019s hand. A snap becomes a backward pass when the snapper releases the ball.

A Pass Play begins with the snap and ends when a forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage is caught by a player of either team or is incomplete. At the instant that a pass is caught, a Running Play begins.  ARTICLE 3.  RUNNING PLAY. A Running Play begins in the following situations: (a) If there is not a subsequent kick or legal or illegal forward pass from behind the line of scrimmage, a Running Play begins with the Snap. (b) If there is a legal or illegal forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage, a Running Play begins when the forward pass is caught by a player of either team. (c) If there is a running play followed by an illegal forward pass thrown from beyond the line of scrimmage, or by an illegal forward pass not from scrimmage, a new Running Play begins when the pass is caught by a player of either team.

Immediately prior to the start of the second half, the captains of both teams must inform the Referee of their respective choices.  A captain\u2019s first choice from any alternative privileges listed above is final and not subject to change.  ARTICLE 3.  CHANGE OF GOALS. At the end of the first and third periods, the teams must change goals. Team possession, the number of the succeeding down, the relative position of the ball on the field of play, and the line to gain remain the same.  SECTION 3 STARTING THE GAME CLOCK ARTICLE 1.  FREE KICK DOWN. The game clock operator shall start the game clock (time in) after a free kick when the ball is legally touched in the field of play. The game clock shall not start if: (a) the receiving team recovers the ball in the end zone and does not carry the ball into the field of play; (b) the kicking team recovers the ball in the field of play (prior to any other legal touching); (c) the receiving team signals for and makes a fair catch.   ARTICLE 2.  SCRIMMAGE DOWN.

Note: No extension of the automatic timeouts in this section shall be allowed unless any player requests a team timeout, or the Referee orders a team timeout or suspends play.  SECTION 5 TIMEOUTS ARTICLE 1.  CHARGED TEAM TIMEOUTS. The Referee shall suspend play while the ball is dead and declare a charged team timeout upon the request for a timeout by the head coach or any player (not a substitute) to any official. If an assistant coach signals for a timeout and it is inadvertently granted, the timeout will stand.    Item 1. Three Timeouts Allowed. A team is allowed three charged team timeouts during each half.  Item 2. Length of Timeouts.

If an official determines a player to be injured, or if attendants from the bench come on the field to assist an injured player, an injury timeout will be called by the Referee. If the ATC Spotter identifies a player for medical attention, the rules pertaining to Injury Timeouts in Article 3 and Article 4 (c) apply.  ARTICLE 3.  INJURY TIMEOUTS PRIOR TO TWO-MINUTE WARNING OF EITHER HALF. When an injury timeout is called, the injured player must leave the game for the completion of one down. The player will be permitted to remain in the game if: (a) either team calls a charged team timeout; (b) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or (c) the period ends or the two-minute warning occurs before the next snap.  At the conclusion of an injury timeout, the game clock will start as if the injury timeout had not occurred. If either team takes, or is charged with, a timeout, the clock will start on the snap.  ARTICLE 4.  INJURY TIMEOUTS AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING OF EITHER HALF. After the two-minute warning of a half, the following shall apply: (a)  If a team has not used its three charged team timeouts, the team of the injured player will be charged a team timeout, unless:  (1) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or  (2) the injury occurs during a down in which there is a change of possession, a touchdown, a safety, a successful field goal, or an attempted Try.  (b) If a team has used its three charged team timeouts, an excess team timeout shall be called by the Referee, unless:   (1) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or  (2) the injury occurs during a down in which there is a change of possession, a touchdown, a safety, a successful field goal, or an attempted Try.  (c) The player must leave the game for the completion of one down, unless:  (1) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or  (2) either team calls or is charged a team timeout other than an excess timeout.  Penalty: For the second and each subsequent excess team timeout after the two-minute warning: Loss of five yards from the succeeding spot for delay of the game. Notes: (1)  No yardage penalty will be assessed for the first excess team timeout, but a 10-second runoff of the game clock may be applicable pursuant to Note 3 below. At the conclusion of an excess timeout taken while time is in, the game clock shall start with the ready-for-play signal. For any excess timeout charged to the defense, the play clock is reset to 40 seconds. (2)  If the Referee has already called an excess team timeout in that half for a team, any subsequent excess timeout for that team will result in a five-yard penalty, and a 10-second runoff of the game clock may be applicable pursuant to Note 3 below. (Such penalty shall be considered a foul between downs and will not offset a foul or be part of a multiple foul). (3)  If an excess team timeout is charged against a team in possession of the ball, and the timeout causes the clock to stop or delays the clock from starting on the ready-for-play signal, the ball shall not be put in play until the time on the game clock has been reduced by 10 seconds, if the defense so chooses.  Supplemental Notes: (1)  Either half can end as the result of the 10-second runoff referenced above. (2) If an injury timeout is called for both teams during or after a down, charged team timeouts and/or excess team timeouts are charged as appropriate, but no yardage or 10-second runoff penalties shall be enforced. (3) If a foul by either team occurs during a down in which there is also an injury, such foul does not affect the charging of an excess timeout, but it does prevent a 10-second runoff that may result from the excess timeout, because the foul stopped the clock.

Provided that calling timeout is not in conflict with another rule, the Referee may suspend play and stop the clock (Referee\u2019s timeout) at any time without penalty to either team when playing time is being consumed because of an unintentional delay. Such situations include, but are not limited to: (a) when there is the possibility of a measurement for a first down, or if the Referee is consulting with a captain about one; (b) when there is an undue pileup on the runner, or while determining possession after a fumble while time is in; (c) when there is an undue delay by officials in spotting the ball for the next snap; (d) if the snap is made before the officials can assume their positions (See 4-6-5-b if it is a repeated act); (e) when there is an injury to an official or member of the chain crew; (f) during an officials\u2019 conference; or (g) while repairing or replacing game equipment, except player equipment.  After a Referee\u2019s timeout, the game clock will start pursuant to Rule 4, Section 3, as if the Referee\u2019s timeout had not occurred.   14", "start_char_idx": 3500, "end_char_idx": 5503, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "274241fe-5545-4e25-9da0-6e5c3a85f030": {"__data__": {"id_": "274241fe-5545-4e25-9da0-6e5c3a85f030", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0d7d45d9-43e0-43a7-ad7f-65b65272f509", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "5c851f9cd72185330318d2ee43dd87c3510f7bddfd3e06fbc5e39f0d45bb1823", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "56c374f8-d70b-474e-ae21-f4c9a8e64e77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "f21e0f058f53dc2a8ab60a9b55780ce881922925a9445daeacb929781e6e8b37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "72e6bbe3-875b-4da9-aae4-4c41448f0d1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "32456e0bc48a3817c06dff52ee40cbfb21149604d8f5735204b0c6eeeea5a4d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rule 4 The time remaining on the play clock shall be the same as when it stopped.

It is a delay of the game if the ball is not put in play by a snap within 40 seconds after the start of the play clock. The play clock operator shall time the interval between plays upon signals from game officials. The 40-second interval starts when a play ends, unless Article 2 below applies.  ARTICLE 2.  25-SECOND PLAY CLOCK. In the event of certain administrative stoppages or other delays, a team will have 25 seconds, beginning with the Referee\u2019s whistle, to put the ball in play next by a snap or a kick. Such stoppages include, but are not limited to: (a) a change of possession; (b) a charged team timeout; (c) the two-minute warning; (d) the expiration of a period; (e) a penalty enforcement; (f) a Try; (g) a Free Kick; or (h)  replay administration pursuant to Rule 15, Section 3, Article 9, if the play clock is under 25 seconds.  A 25-second interval will be used in these situations, even if the 40-second clock is already counting down.  Note: Following a Try or successful field-goal attempt, unless there is a commercial break, the teams will have 40 seconds to align prior to the ball being made ready for play. When the 40 seconds have elapsed, the 25-second play clock will begin.  ARTICLE 3.  INTERRUPTION OF PLAY CLOCK. If the play clock is stopped prior to the snap for any reason, after the stoppage has concluded, the time remaining on the play clock shall be the same as when it stopped, unless: (a) the stoppage has been for a charged team timeout, the two-minute warning, the expiration of a period, a penalty  enforcement, or an Instant Replay challenge prior to the two-minute warning, in which case the play clock shall be reset to 25 seconds; (b) the stoppage has been for an Instant Replay review after the two-minute warning that results in a reversal, in which case the play clock shall be reset to 25 seconds; (c) the stoppage has been for an excess timeout while time is in that is charged to the defense, in which case the play clock shall be reset to 40 seconds; or (d) fewer than 10 seconds remain on the play clock, in which case it shall be reset to 10 seconds, or the exact time on the play clock at the discretion of the Referee.  ARTICLE 4.  BALL REMAINS DEAD. If the ball is not put in play within the applicable period, the Back Judge shall blow his whistle for the foul, and the ball remains dead. See 14-4-1-Item 1.  ARTICLE 5.  OTHER DELAY OF GAME FOULS. Other examples of action or inaction that are to be construed as delay of the game include, but are not limited to: (a) a player unnecessarily remains on a dead ball or on a runner who has been downed; (b) the snapper repeatedly snaps the ball after the neutral zone is established and before all the officials have had a reasonable time to assume their positions (see 7-6-3-c); (c) undue delay by either team in assembling after a timeout; (d) a defensive player aligned in a stationary position within one yard of the line of scrimmage makes quick and abrupt actions that are not a part of normal defensive player movement and are an obvious attempt to cause an offensive player(s) to foul (false start). The officials shall blow their whistles immediately. If the defender is walking or running toward the line of scrimmage in an effort to time the snap, but stops abruptly because the snap is not made, it is not a foul for delay of game; (e) spiking or throwing the ball in the field of play after a down has ended, except after a score; (f) intentional contact with the football to delay the snap or the officials\u2019 ability to make the ball ready for play; or (g) when a timeout is erroneously granted.

A team is not permitted to conserve time after the two-minute warning of either half by committing any of these acts: (a) a foul by either team that prevents the snap (i.e., false start, encroachment, etc.); (b) intentional grounding; (c) an illegal forward pass; (d) throwing a backward pass out of bounds;  (e) spiking or throwing the ball in the field of play after a down has ended, except after a touchdown; or (f) any intentional foul that causes the clock to stop.  Penalty: For Illegally Conserving Time: Loss of five yards unless a larger distance penalty is applicable.  When actions referred to above are committed by the offensive team while time is in, officials will run off 10 seconds from the game clock before permitting the ball to be put in play on the ready-for-play signal. The game clock will start on the ready-for-play signal unless another rule prescribes otherwise.

If the defense has timeouts remaining, it will have the option of using a timeout in lieu of the game clock being started.   Notes: (1)  Two successive delay penalties during the same down when time is in, is unsportsmanlike conduct (12-3-1-n). After enforcement of the 15-yard penalty, the game clock shall start on the snap.  (2) Certain acts of delay may involve stopping the game clock immediately. Repeated violations of the substitution rule to conserve time are unsportsmanlike conduct (12-3-1-m and 5-2).   ARTICLE 2.  SUBSTITUTION VIOLATION AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING. After the two-minute warning of either half, if there is a violation of the substitution rule while the ball is dead and time is in, in addition to the applicable yardage penalty for illegal substitution, there will be a 10-second runoff pursuant to Article 1 above, unless it is obvious that the offensive team is not attempting to conserve time.  Penalty: For Illegal Substitution: Loss of five yards (unless a larger distance penalty is applicable) and a 10-second runoff.   ARTICLE 3.  DEFENSIVE FOULS DURING LAST 40 SECONDS. In the last 40 seconds of either half, if there is a defensive foul prior to the snap while time is in, the half will end, unless the defense has timeouts remaining, or the offense chooses to have the Game Clock start on the snap.  ARTICLE 4.  REPLAY REVIEW AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING OF EITHER HALF. If a replay review after the two-minute warning of either half results in the on-field ruling being reversed and the correct ruling would not have stopped the game clock, then the officials will run 10 seconds off the game clock before permitting the ball to be put in play on the ready-for-play signal. The defense cannot decline the runoff, but either team can use a remaining timeout to prevent it.  SECTION 8 EXTENSION OF A PERIOD OR A HALF ARTICLE 1.  BALL IN PLAY. If time expires at the end of any period while the ball is in play, the period continues until the down ends.  ARTICLE 2.  PERIOD EXTENDED. At the election of the opponent, a period may be extended for one untimed down, if any of the following occurs during a down during which time in the period expires, or during which the period had been extended pursuant to this Article: (a) If there is a live-ball foul by the defensive team that is accepted, the offensive team may choose to extend the period by an untimed down after enforcement of the penalty. If the first or third period is not so extended, any accepted penalty is enforced before the start of the succeeding period. (b) If there is a foul by the offense, there shall be no extension of the period. If the foul occurs on the last play of the half, a score by the offense is not counted. However, the period may be extended for an untimed down, upon the request of the defense, if the offensive team\u2019s foul is for:   (1) illegal touching of a kick;   Note: The period may also be extended for a \u201cfirst touching\u201d violation.   (2) fair-catch interference;   (3) a palpably unfair act;   (4) a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul committed during a down prior to a safety, an interception of a forward pass, the recovery of a backward pass or fumble, or the offensive team failing to reach the line to gain on fourth down; or  (5) a foul by the kicking team prior to a player of the receiving team securing possession of the ball during a down in which there is a safety kick, a scrimmage kick, or a free kick. (c) If a touchdown is made on the last play of a period, the Try attempt shall be made (except during a sudden-death period, or if a touchdown is scored during a down in which time in the fourth period expires, and a successful Try would not affect the outcome of the game).

NUMBER OF PLAYERS. The game is played by two teams of 11 players each.   If Team A has more than 11 players in its formation for more than three seconds, or if Team B has more than 11 players in its formation and the snap is imminent, it is a foul. Once the ball is made ready for play, if either team has more than 11 players in its formation prior to a free kick, it is also a foul. In these instances, game officials shall blow their whistles immediately and not allow the snap or kick to occur.  Penalty: For more than 11 players in the formation prior to the snap or free kick: Loss of five yards from the succeeding spot.  If a team has more than 11 players on the field of play or the end zone when a snap, free kick, or fair-catch kick is made, the ball is in play, and it is a foul.  Penalty: For more than 11 players on the field of play or the end zone while the ball is in play: Loss of five yards from the previous spot.  Note: It is not a foul if a team has fewer than 11 players on the field of play or the end zone when a snap, free kick, or fair-catch kick is made.  ARTICLE 2.  PLAYERS NUMBERED BY POSITION. All players must wear numerals on their jerseys in accordance with Rule 5, Section 4, Article 3, Item 3. Such numerals must be by playing position, as follows:  (a) quarterbacks, punters, and placekickers: 1-19; (b) defensive backs: 1-49; (c) running backs, fullbacks, tight ends, H-backs, and wide receivers: 1-49 and 80-89; (d)  offensive linemen: 50-79; (e) defensive linemen: 50-79 and 90-99; (f) linebackers: 1-59 and 90-99.  If a player changes his position during his playing career in the NFL, and such change moves him from a position as an ineligible pass receiver to that of an eligible pass receiver, or from a position as an eligible pass receiver to that of an ineligible pass receiver, he must be issued an appropriate new jersey numeral. A change in jersey numeral is not required if the change is from an ineligible position to another ineligible position, or from an eligible position to another eligible position, provided that the player has participated at least one season at his position prior to the change.  Any request to wear a numeral for a special position not specified above must be made to the Commissioner. During the preseason period when playing rosters are larger, the League will allow duplication and other temporary deviations from the numbering scheme specified above, but the rule must be adhered to for all players during the regular season and postseason. Clubs must make numerals available to adhere to the rule, even if it requires returning to circulation a numeral that has been retired or withheld for other reasons. See 5-3-1 for reporting a change of position.  SECTION 2  SUBSTITUTES AND WITHDRAWN PLAYERS ARTICLE 1.  NUMBER OF PLAYERS IN HUDDLE. There can never be more than 11 players in the offensive huddle while the play clock is running. It is a foul, the whistle is blown immediately, and the ball remains dead. See 5-2-8-a.  ARTICLE 2.  SUBSTITUTE BECOMES PLAYER. A substitute becomes a player when he: (a) participates in at least one play (including a play negated by penalty prior to the snap or during the play); or (b) is on the field of play or the end zone when a snap, fair-catch kick, or free kick is made, or when a snap, fair-catch kick, or free kick is imminent.  A player becomes a substitute when he is withdrawn from the game and does not participate in at least one play. A play negated by penalty prior to the snap or during the play counts as a missed play.  ARTICLE 3.  LEGAL SUBSTITUTIONS. Any number of substitutes may enter the field of play or the end zone while the ball is dead.  ARTICLE 4.  ILLEGAL SUBSTITUTIONS.

Any number of substitutes may enter the field of play or the end zone while the ball is dead.  ARTICLE 4.  ILLEGAL SUBSTITUTIONS. If a substitute enters the field of play or the end zone while the ball is in play, it is an illegal substitution. If an illegal substitute interferes with the play, it may be a palpably unfair act (see 12-3-4).  ARTICLE 5.  OFFENSIVE SUBSTITUTIONS. The following are applicable to any offensive substitute who is entering the game: (a) He must move onto the field of play or the end zone as far as the inside of the field numerals prior to the snap to be a legal substitution. If he does not, and is on the field of play or end zone at the time of a legal snap, he is an illegal substitute. (b) If he approaches the huddle and communicates with a teammate, he is required to participate in at least one play before being withdrawn. After a warning, subsequent violations of this rule shall be penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct. See 5-2-11.  Note: The intent of the rule is to prevent teams from using simulated substitutions to confuse an opponent, while still permitting a player (or players) to enter and leave without participating in a play in certain situations, such as a change in a coaching decision on fourth down, even though he has approached the huddle and communicated with a teammate. Similarly, if a player who participated in the previous play leaves the playing field by mistake, and returns to the playing field prior to the snap, he is not required to reach the inside of the field numerals, provided the defense has the opportunity to match up with him. However, a substitute (i.e., someone who did not participate in the previous play) is required to reach the inside of the field numerals.  18", "start_char_idx": 3134, "end_char_idx": 5430, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d09cd55b-6b92-4448-bbf3-91dc1de2b5e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d09cd55b-6b92-4448-bbf3-91dc1de2b5e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "79c0d6f9-0429-4456-ad1c-5d61e0c93743", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "75f6d34bbaad904fd8afaaae41c416e3b960994380068638b531b1fd3db47822", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3bc8e891-47f1-4558-aa20-7661499cdec2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "13725e4596e3b201ee8b33661bd3abeee7bf0f51f7e99d41fc007951dcea64ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5d05075a-73df-4406-9a45-3b5d81a744fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "02db37436ad659de71f9252d5e7fceebc3c639b99933576dd5a5fb6cd4e1535e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rule 5 ARTICLE 6.  WITHDRAWN PLAYERS. A player or players who have been replaced must leave the playing field or end zone on their own team\u2019s side between the end lines prior to the next snap, free kick, or fair-catch kick.  ARTICLE 7.  DISQUALIFIED AND SUSPENDED PLAYERS. A player must be withdrawn and substituted for when he is disqualified (12-2, 12-3) or suspended (5-4). A suspended player may re-enter after at least one legal snap, provided that the reason for his suspension has been corrected. A disqualified player must leave the playing field enclosure and go to the team locker room within a reasonable time.  ARTICLE 8.  PENALTIES FOR ILLEGAL SUBSTITUTION OR WITHDRAWAL. Penalties are: (a) For 12 or more players in the offensive huddle (whistle blown immediately and ball remains dead): Loss of five yards from the succeeding spot. (b) For a substitute entering the field during a live ball: Loss of five yards. (c) For interference with the play by a substitute who enters the field during a live ball: Palpably unfair act. See 12-3-4. (d) For an offensive substitute who does not move onto the field as far as the inside of the field numerals: Loss of five yards from the previous spot. (e) For a withdrawn player clearing the field on the opponents\u2019 side or across an end line: Loss of five yards from the previous spot. (f) For illegal return of a suspended player: Loss of five yards from the previous spot if discovery is made while the ball is in play, or five yards from the succeeding spot if discovered between downs, in which case the ball remains dead. (g) For return of a disqualified player: Loss of 15 yards from the previous spot if discovery is made while the ball is in play, or 15 yards from the succeeding spot if discovered between downs, in which case the ball remains dead, and, in either case, exclusion from the playing field enclosure.  Note: If the illegal return of a player is not discovered until the end of a down, but prior to the start of the next one, enforcement is from the previous spot when definitely known. Otherwise, enforcement is from the succeeding spot as a foul between downs. See 14-4-9.  ARTICLE 9.  PROCEDURE FOLLOWING TIMEOUT OR CHANGE OF POSSESSION. Following a timeout or change of possession, the offense may huddle outside the numbers near its bench area, but will not be allowed to line up and snap the ball before the defense has an opportunity to match personnel. If the offense snaps the ball before the defense has had an opportunity to complete its substitutions, and a defensive foul for too many players on the field results, no penalties will be enforced, except for personal fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, and the down will be replayed. At this time, the Referee will notify the head coach that any further use of this tactic will result in a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.  Penalty: For Unsportsmanlike Conduct after a warning: Loss of 15 yards from the succeeding spot.  ARTICLE 10.  DEFENSIVE MATCHUPS FOLLOWING SUBSTITUTIONS. If a substitution is made by the offense, the offense shall not be permitted to snap the ball until the defense has been permitted to respond with its substitutions. While in the process of a substitution (or simulated substitution), the offense is prohibited from rushing quickly to the line of scrimmage and snapping the ball in an obvious attempt to cause a defensive foul (i.e., too many men on the field). If the offense substitutes, the following procedure will apply:  (a) The Umpire will stand over the ball until the Referee deems that the defense has had a reasonable time to complete its substitutions. (b) If the offense snaps the ball before the defense has had an opportunity to complete its substitutions, and a defensive foul for too many players on the field results, no penalties will be enforced, except for personal fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct, and the down will be replayed. At this time, the Referee will notify the head coach that any further use of this tactic will result in a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.

(c) On a fourth-down punting situation, the Referee and the Umpire will not allow a quick snap that prevents the defense from having a reasonable time to complete its substitutions. This applies throughout the entire game. (d) If the play clock expires before the defense has completed its substitution, it is delay of game by the offense.  ARTICLE 11.  UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT. Using entering substitutes, legally returning players, substitutes on sidelines, or withdrawn players to confuse opponents, or lingering by players leaving the field when being replaced by a substitute, is unsportsmanlike conduct. See 12-3-1-l. The offense is prevented from sending simulated substitutions onto the field toward its huddle and returning them to the sideline without completing the substitution in an attempt to confuse the defense.  Penalty: For Unsportsmanlike Conduct: Loss of 15 yards.  SECTION 3 CHANGES IN POSITION ARTICLE 1.  REPORTING CHANGE OF POSITION. An offensive player wearing the number of an ineligible pass receiver (50\u201379 and 90\u201399) is permitted to line up in the position of an eligible pass receiver (1\u201349 and 80\u201389), and an offensive player wearing the number of an eligible pass receiver is permitted to line up in the position of an ineligible pass receiver, provided that he immediately reports the change in his eligibility status to the Referee, who will inform the defensive team.  He must participate in such eligible or ineligible position as long as he is continuously in the game, but prior to each play he must again report his status to the Referee, who will inform the defensive team. The game clock shall not be stopped, and the ball shall not be put in play until the Referee takes his normal position.  19", "start_char_idx": 3436, "end_char_idx": 6058, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bf7c4af-3b59-4c75-8d45-4a304ee10595": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bf7c4af-3b59-4c75-8d45-4a304ee10595", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a017435-d4d3-4577-84bf-269813349796", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "639bc211644d98a51c26af837f20e803a15de94e5c8202d9a0e6a9d5416b3664", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d05075a-73df-4406-9a45-3b5d81a744fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "8d32e47142d6a50209b32715e4080580801af957d0538b3b517351a82a4dbb67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "58e48dc2-49a3-4322-9a54-0770c5384912", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f666c3ec59f0225ef726d3f23f2017622324d07ec14b31bd0f2e76243ac8d097", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rule 5 Note: An offensive player wearing the number of an eligible pass receiver who reports as ineligible must line up within the normal five-player core formed by ineligible players. The player cannot be more than two players removed from the middle player of a seven-player line.  ARTICLE 2.  RETURNING TO ORIGINAL POSITION. A player who has reported a change in his eligibility status to the Referee is permitted to return to a position indicated by the eligibility status of his number after: (a) a team time out;  (b) the end of a quarter;  (c) the two-minute warning;  (d) a foul;  (e) a replay review;  (f) a touchdown;  (g) a kick from scrimmage;  (h) a change of possession; or (i) if the player has been withdrawn for one legal snap. A player withdrawn for one legal snap may re-enter at a position indicated by the eligibility status of his number, unless he again reports to the Referee that he is assuming a position other than that designated by the eligibility status of his number.  Penalty: If a player fails to notify the Referee of a change in his status when required, or an offensive player with an eligible number reports as ineligible and lines up outside the tackle box: Loss of five yards for illegal substitution.  ARTICLE 3.  SPEAKERS IN HELMETS. The Coach-to-Player system allows a member of the coaching staff in the bench area or the coaches\u2019 booth to communicate to a designated offensive or defensive player with a speaker in his helmet. The communication begins once a game official has signaled a down to be over and is cut off when the play clock reaches 15 seconds or the ball is snapped, whichever occurs first.  Each offensive and defensive team is permitted no more than one player on the field with a speaker in his helmet. Each team is permitted to have a maximum of three active radio receivers to be used on offense by its quarterbacks, and a maximum of three active radio receivers to be used on defense by players who have been designated as a primary and backup users.  Clubs that have a player whose principal position is as a non-quarterback (e.g., wide receiver, running back) and who also is used as a quarterback from time to time must have two helmets for that player\u2014one with and one without radio components.  When a quarterback enters the game for the first time, or re-enters the game if he has previously been in the game and removed, he must report to the Referee.   Whenever the backup defensive user enters or re-enters the game wearing a helmet with a speaker, he must report to the Umpire. If the primary defensive user subsequently re-enters the game wearing a helmet with a speaker, he must report to the Umpire. If the primary and backup players have been removed from the game, no other player may wear the radio speaker in his helmet. Teams must use other methods to communicate signals to their players.  It is not necessary that the offensive player with the speaker in his helmet receive the snap.   For special teams\u2019 plays, only one player per team with a receiver will be permitted on the field.  All players that have radio components in their helmet must have a decal, supplied by the League, displayed on the midline of the rear of the helmet. Players who have speakers in their helmets must be identified in the Communication System section of the Game Day Administration Report that is submitted to the Referee or a member of his crew no later than one hour and 30 minutes prior to kickoff.  For additional requirements and policies pertaining to the system, including regulations for the storage of a backup helmet for a non-quarterback who is used as a quarterback, or for the backup defensive player\u2019s helmet, please refer to the Policy Manual for Member Clubs/Game Operations.

FREE KICK. A free kick is a kickoff or safety kick that puts the ball in play to start a free kick down. It must be made from any point on the kicking team\u2019s restraining line and between the inbounds lines. (a) A kickoff puts the ball in play at the start of each half, after a try, and after a successful field goal. A dropkick or placekick may be used for a kickoff.  Note: During a placekick on a kickoff, the kicking team may use a manufactured tee that is one inch in height and approved by the League. Once the ball has been placed on the kicking tee, the kicking tee cannot be moved. If the ball falls off the tee, the covering officials must stop play and restart the timing process without penalty to the kicking team. If the ball falls off the tee a second time during the same free kick down, the kicking team then must either use a player to hold the ball or must kick it off the ground. The ball may be placed on the ground leaning against the tee, provided the tee is in its normal upright position.  (b) A safety kick puts the ball in play after a safety. A dropkick, placekick, or punt may be used for a safety kick. A tee cannot be used for a safety kick.  Penalty: For illegal kick on a free kick down: Loss of five yards.  ARTICLE 2.  RESTRAINING LINES. The restraining lines for a free kick shall be as follows, unless they are adjusted because of a distance penalty: (a) The restraining line for the kicking team shall be its 35-yard line for a kickoff and its 20-yard line for a safety kick. (b) The restraining line for the receiving team shall be the yard line 10 yards in advance of the kicking team\u2019s restraining line.  ARTICLE 3.  FREE KICK FORMATION. When the ball is kicked on a free kick down: (a) From the time the kicker begins his approach to the ball and until the ball is kicked,  (1)  all kicking team players other than the kicker must be lined up with at least one foot on the yard line that is one yard behind their restraining line, and both feet must remain on the ground until the ball is kicked; and  (2)  no more than five players of the kicking team may be on either side of the ball; and  (3) at least two players (other than a holder) must be lined up inbounds between the sideline and the bottom (outside) of the yard-line number, and at least two players (other than a holder) must be lined up between the top (inside) of the yard-line number and the inbounds lines.  Note: A holder for a free kick counts as one of the required five players on either side of the ball, regardless of where he is positioned. The holder is never counted as one of the required two players between the inbounds line and the top (inside) of the numbers, regardless of where he is positioned.  (b) All kicking team players must be inbounds and behind the ball when it is kicked, except: (1) the holder of a placekick (3-18-1-Item 2) may be beyond the line, and (2) the kicker may be beyond the line, provided that his kicking foot is not beyond the line. (c) Until the ball is kicked, all receiving team (Team B) players must be inbounds and behind their restraining line, and at least eight, but no more than nine, players must be positioned between their restraining line and a spot 15 yards behind their restraining line (the \u201csetup zone\u201d). (See Section 2, Article 1, Item 2-b).  Penalty: For a player being beyond the restraining line when the ball is kicked (offside), a player being out of bounds when the ball is kicked, or either team being in an illegal formation when the ball is kicked: Loss of five yards.

ARTICLE 6.  END OF FREE KICK. A free kick ends when either team possesses the ball, or when the ball is dead, if that precedes possession. A running play begins when the receiving team establishes possession of the ball.  SECTION 2 OTHER FREE KICK FOULS ARTICLE 1.  BLOCKING. Item 1. Kicking Team.  (a) Between the Restraining Lines (10 Yards). Until the ball is legally touched, a kicking team player may not block or use his hands or arms against an opponent between the restraining lines, except to push or pull aside a receiver who is actively attempting to obstruct his attempt to proceed downfield. After the ball is legally touched, a kicking team player may legally block an opponent, and he may use his hands and arms to push or pull an opponent out of the way in a personal attempt to recover the ball. (b) At or Five Yards Beyond Receiver\u2019s Restraining Line (Next Five Yards). Until the ball is legally touched or touches the ground, a kicking team player may not block or use his hands or arms against an opponent in the area that is at or no more than five yards beyond the receiving team\u2019s restraining line, except to push or pull aside a receiver who is actively attempting to obstruct his attempt to proceed downfield.  After the ball is legally touched or touches the ground, a kicking team player may legally block an opponent anywhere, and he may use his hands and arms to push or pull an opponent out of the way in a personal attempt to recover the ball. (c) More than 15 Yards Beyond Kicker\u2019s Restraining Line. The kicking team may legally block more than 15 yards beyond its restraining line.  During the kick, the kicking team is subject to the blocking restrictions of the defense.  For the exception prohibiting a block in the back by the kicking team while the ball is in flight, see 12-1-3-b-Note.  Item 2. Receiving Team. (a) First 15 Yards. Until the ball is legally touched or the ball hits the ground, no player on the receiving team may initiate a block against the kicking team in the 15-yard area between the kicking team\u2019s restraining line and five yards behind the receiving team\u2019s restraining line. (b) More than 15 Yards Beyond Kicker\u2019s Restraining Line. The receiving team may legally block more than 15 yards beyond the kicking team\u2019s restraining line. (c) After the ball is kicked, receiving team players are subject to the blocking restrictions of the offense (see 12-1-1 through 12-1-3), and they may use their hands/arms legally to push or pull an opponent out of the way in a personal attempt to recover the ball.  Penalty: For illegal blocking or use of hands by either team: Loss of 10 yards.   (d) A \u201cdouble-team block\u201d is permissible only by players who were initially lined up in the setup zone at the time of the kick. Any other players may not participate in a double-team block at any time during a kick or during a return. A double-team block is defined as two or more players who contact an opponent at the same time. (e) A \u201cwedge block\u201d is not permitted by any players at any time. A wedge block is defined as two or more players intentionally aligning shoulder-to-shoulder within two yards of each other, and who move forward together. The foul for a wedge block occurs at that point; actual contact with an opponent is not necessary.  Penalty: For an illegal wedge block or an illegal double-team block: Loss of 15 yards. If the foul occurs during the kick, enforcement is from the spot of the foul. If the foul occurs during the return, the penalty is enforced as customary. If the foul occurs in the receiving team\u2019s end zone during the kick, it is enforced from the previous spot.  ARTICLE 2.  RUNNING INTO FREE KICKER. A player of the receiving team is not permitted to run into the kicker before he recovers his balance. See also 12-2-8-h for personal fouls against the kicker.

The ball remains dead if it is snapped or kicked before it is made ready for play.  SECTION 2 DEAD BALL ARTICLE 1.  DEAD BALL DECLARED. An official shall declare the ball dead and the down ended: (a) when a runner is contacted by an opponent and touches the ground with any part of his body other than his hands or feet. The ball is dead the instant the runner touches the ground. A runner touching the ground with his hands or feet while in the grasp of an opponent may continue to advance;  Note: If, after contact by an opponent, any part of a runner\u2019s leg above the ankle or any part of his arm above the wrist touches the ground, the runner is down.   (b) when a runner is held or otherwise restrained so that his forward progress ends; (c) when a quarterback immediately drops to his knee (or simulates dropping to his knee) behind the line of scrimmage;  Note: If a quarterback does not immediately drop to a knee, and contact from a rushing defender is unavoidable, it is not a foul unless the defender commits some other act that would constitute unnecessary roughness.   (d) when a runner declares himself down by: (1) falling to the ground or kneeling, and clearly making no immediate effort to advance; or (2) sliding. When a runner slides feet or head first or simulates sliding, the ball is dead the instant he touches the ground with anything other than his hands or his feet, or begins to simulate touching the ground;  Notes: (1) Defenders are required to treat a sliding runner as they would a runner who is down by contact. (2) A defender must pull up when a runner begins a slide. This does not mean that all contact by a defender is illegal. If a defender has already committed himself, and the contact is unavoidable, it is not a foul unless the defender makes forcible contact into the head or neck area of the runner with the helmet, shoulder, or forearm, or commits some other act that is unnecessary roughness. (3) A runner who desires to take advantage of this protection is responsible for starting his slide before contact by a defensive player is imminent; if he does not, and waits until the last moment to begin his slide, he puts himself in jeopardy of being contacted.  (e) when a runner is out of bounds; (f) when an opponent takes a ball that is in the possession of a runner who is on the ground;  Note: An opponent may take or grab a ball (hand to hand) in possession of a runner who is on his feet or is airborne.  (g) when a forward pass (legal or illegal) is incomplete (See 8-1-4); (h) when any legal or illegal kick touches the receivers\u2019 goal posts or crossbar, unless it scores a field goal (See 9-4-2); (i) when a loose ball comes to rest anywhere in the field, and no player attempts to recover it; the official covering the play should pause momentarily before signaling that the ball is dead. Any legal (or illegal) kick is awarded to the receivers, and any other ball is awarded to the team last in possession. When awarded to a team behind a goal line, the ball is placed on the one-yard line; (j) when any legal or illegal kick is caught or recovered by the kickers, except a scrimmage kick that is kicked from behind the line and is recovered behind the line (not a Try kick) (See 9-3-2-Item 3 for exception); (k) when a touchdown, touchback, safety, field goal, or Try has been made; (l) when any receiver catches or recovers the ball after a fair catch signal (valid or invalid) has been made, provided the ball has not been touched by an opponent, before or after it strikes the ground; (m) when an official sounds the whistle erroneously while the ball is still in play, the ball becomes dead immediately; (1) If the ball is in player possession, the team in possession may elect to put the ball in play where it has been declared dead or to replay the down.  (2)  If the ball is a loose ball resulting from a fumble, backward pass, or illegal forward pass, the team last in possession may elect to put the ball in play at the spot where possession was lost or to replay the down.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4280, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20383e56-95a0-4fad-b62b-a3cae34a1648": {"__data__": {"id_": "20383e56-95a0-4fad-b62b-a3cae34a1648", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90746881-e0db-4e91-ba91-e493158803bb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "449e2e681339b616ef7b7c96d10f83979af259e5ae57f865a3c64eee4208fb31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c7bb504-ebae-4257-b676-9e7cc6572f77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "db91c2f145687a0e8dd29875b6549c537883b8ec9bd970b9cf2d9918f1963289", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "05e030d1-95e1-4b03-ae63-adca4846d509", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd06e647be64eb7412ed57801dacc966fa56896be1c567469aa728052e62cc19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(2)  If the ball is a loose ball resulting from a fumble, backward pass, or illegal forward pass, the team last in possession may elect to put the ball in play at the spot where possession was lost or to replay the down.

Penalty enforcement following the play is as ordinary for fouls during runs or kicks.  ARTICLE 2.  BALL TOUCHES OFFICIAL. The ball is not dead because it touches an official who is inbounds, or because of a signal by an official other than a whistle.  SECTION 3 NEW SERIES OF DOWNS ARTICLE 1.  NEW SERIES FOR TEAM A. A new series of four scrimmage downs is awarded to Team A when the following conditions exist: (a) During a given series, the ball is declared dead in possession of Team A while at or beyond the line to gain. (b) Enforcement of a foul by Team B results in the placement of the ball at or beyond the line to gain,   or if the enforcement of a foul awards an automatic first down to Team A. (c) If there is a change of possession during the down, and Team A has possession at the end of the down. (d) The kicking team recovers a scrimmage kick anywhere in the field of play after it first has been touched beyond the line of scrimmage by the receivers. See 9-3-2-Item 1. (e) The kicking team legally recovers a free kick.  ARTICLE 2.  NEW SERIES FOR TEAM B. A new series of four scrimmage downs is awarded to Team B when the following conditions exist: (a) Team A fails to advance the ball to the line to gain during a series of downs; or  (b) There is a change of possession during the down, and Team B has possession at the end of the down, or has been awarded possession at the end of the down; or  (c)  When the ball is declared dead in possession of the receiving team after a free kick, scrimmage kick, or fair-catch kick.  ARTICLE 3.  FORWARD PART OF BALL. The forward part of the ball in its position when it is declared dead in the field of play shall be the determining point in measuring any distance gained or lost. The ball shall be rotated so that its long axis is parallel to the sidelines before measuring, while maintaining the forward most point.  Note: When an airborne player of either team completes a catch or interception inbounds after an opponent has driven him backward, the ball is declared dead, and forward progress is awarded at the spot where initial contact by the opponent was made after the player established firm grip and control of the ball while in the air.  SECTION 4 ACTION AT OR BEFORE THE SNAP ARTICLE 1.  BALL READY FOR PLAY. After the neutral zone has been established (ball is made or declared ready for play), an offensive player may not make a false start, a defensive player may not encroach (initiate contact with a member of the offensive team) or commit a neutral zone infraction, and no player of either team may be offside when the ball is put in play.  ARTICLE 2.  FALSE START. It is a False Start if the ball has been placed ready for play, and, prior to the snap, an offensive player who has assumed a set position charges or moves in such a way as to simulate the start of a play, or if an offensive player who is in motion makes a sudden movement toward the line of scrimmage. Any quick abrupt movement by a single offensive player, or by several offensive players in unison, which simulates the start of the snap, is a false start.  Exception: This does not apply to an offensive player under the center who turns his head or shoulders, unless the movement is an obvious attempt to draw an opponent offside.

It is a False Start if an interior lineman (tackle to tackle) takes or simulates a three-point stance, and then changes his position or moves the hand that is on the ground.  An interior lineman who is in a two-point stance is permitted to reset in a three-point stance or change his position, provided that he comes to a complete stop prior to the snap. If he does not come to a complete stop prior to the snap, it is a False Start.  Item 2. Eligible Receiver. If all 11 offensive players have been set for at least one full second, and an eligible receiver who is on the line of scrimmage moves forward, it is a False Start, regardless of whether the action is quick and abrupt or slow and deliberate.

A player who is in position to receive the snap in shotgun formation is permitted to shift his feet prior to the snap, but any quick and abrupt movement is a False Start. This includes thrusting his hands forward when there is not a simultaneous snap.  Item 5. Attempt to Draw Offside. Any obvious attempt by the quarterback or other player in position to receive the snap to draw an opponent offside is a False Start.   Item 6. Offense Not Set. With the game clock running after the two-minute warning of either half, if all 11 offensive players are not set simultaneously for one full second prior to the snap, it is a False Start.  Penalty: For a False Start: Loss of five yards from the line of scrimmage. The foul is enforced prior to the snap.  Note: The official shall blow the whistle immediately. The penalty for a False Start shall be enforced regardless of whether the snap is made or there is a reaction by the defense.   ARTICLE 3.  ENCROACHMENT. It is Encroachment if a defensive player enters the neutral zone and contacts an offensive player or the ball prior to the snap, or if he interferes with the ball during the snap. The play is dead immediately.  Penalty: For Encroachment: Loss of five yards from the line of scrimmage. The foul is enforced prior to the snap.  ARTICLE 4.  NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION. It is a Neutral Zone Infraction when: (a) a defender moves beyond the neutral zone prior to the snap and is parallel to or beyond an offensive lineman, with an unimpeded path to the quarterback or kicker, even though no contact is made by a blocker; officials are to blow their whistles immediately (b) a defender enters the neutral zone prior to the snap, causing the offensive player(s) in close proximity (including a quarterback who is under center) to react (move) immediately to protect himself (themselves) against impending contact; officials are to blow their whistles immediately. If there is no immediate reaction by the offensive player(s) in close proximity, and the defensive player returns to a legal position prior to the snap without contacting an opponent, there is no foul. A flexed or split receiver is considered to be in close proximity if he is lined up on the side of the ball on which the violation occurs; other offensive players are considered to be in close proximity if they are within two-and-one-half positions of the defender who enters the neutral zone. If the defender is directly over the center, a quarterback under center, the center, and the guards and tackles on both sides of the center are considered to be within close proximity; if the defender is in a gap, the two offensive players on either side of the gap are considered to be within close proximity (including a quarterback under center, if applicable) (c) a player, after he has received a warning, enters the neutral zone. It is a foul, even if he returns to a legal position prior to the snap without contacting an opponent or causing a reaction (movement) by an offensive player in close proximity.  Note: During the last two minutes of a half, after the ball has been spotted for the succeeding down at the line of scrimmage and the offense is legally set, if the ball is snapped before all members of the defensive team are on their side of the line of scrimmage, play shall be stopped immediately, and the defensive team penalized five yards for a neutral zone infraction.  Penalty: For a Neutral Zone Infraction: Loss of five yards from line of scrimmage. Foul is enforced prior to snap.  ARTICLE 5.  OFFSIDE. A player is offside when any part of his body is in or beyond the neutral zone or beyond a restraining line when the ball is put in play.   Penalty: For offside: Loss of five yards.  ARTICLE 6.

Penalty: For illegal formation by the offense: Loss of five yards.  SECTION 6 PUTTING THE BALL IN PLAY ARTICLE 1.  BALL IN PLAY. The offensive team must put the ball in play with a snap at the spot where the previous down ended, unless the enforcement of a penalty moves the ball to another spot or the down ended outside the inbounds lines. If a fair-catch kick is chosen after a fair catch, 10-2-1 and 11-4-3 apply.  ARTICLE 2.  SNAP AT INBOUNDS SPOT.

(b) It is not necessary that the snap be between the snapper\u2019s legs, but it must be one quick and continuous motion of the hand or hands of the snapper. The ball must leave or be taken from his hands during this motion. (c) The snapper may not snap the ball after it is ready for play until all of the officials have had a reasonable time to assume their normal positions. If this occurs, the ball remains dead, and no penalty is assessed unless it is a repeated act after a warning (delay of game).

DEFINITION. It is a forward pass if: (a) the ball initially moves forward (to a point nearer the opponent\u2019s goal line) after leaving the passer\u2019s hand(s) (b) the ball first strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else at a point that is nearer the opponent\u2019s goal line than the point at which the ball leaves the passer\u2019s hand(s).  Note: A ball that is intentionally fumbled and goes forward is a forward pass. A ball that is intentionally muffed, and goes forward or backward, is a batted ball (12-5-1-Note).  Item 1. Forward Movement of Hand. When a player is in control of the ball and is attempting to pass it forward, any intentional forward movement of his hand starts a forward pass. (a) If contact by an opponent materially affects a passer after the passer begins his throwing motion, it is a forward pass if he passes the ball, regardless of where the ball strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else. When this occurs, intentional grounding rules do not apply. (b)  When a passer intends to throw a forward pass and is contacted by an opponent before beginning his throwing motion, the direction of the pass is the responsibility of the passer if he passes the ball, and intentional grounding rules apply. (c) If, after an intentional forward movement of his hand, the passer loses possession of the ball during an attempt to bring it back toward his body, it is a fumble. (d) If the passer loses possession of the ball while attempting to re-cock his arm, it is a fumble.  ARTICLE 2.  LEGAL FORWARD PASS. The offensive team may make one forward pass from behind the line during each down. If the ball, whether in player possession or loose, crosses the line of scrimmage, a forward pass is not permissible, regardless of whether the ball returns behind the line of scrimmage before the pass is thrown.  Item 1. Illegal Passes. Any other forward pass by either team is illegal and is a foul by the passing team, including: (a) A forward pass thrown when the passer is beyond the line of scrimmage.  Note: It is a forward pass from beyond the line of scrimmage if the passer\u2019s entire body and the ball are beyond the line of scrimmage when the ball is released, whether the passer is airborne or touching the ground. The penalty for a forward pass thrown from beyond the line is enforced from the spot where the ball is released.  (b) A second forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage. (c) A forward pass thrown after the ball has crossed the line of scrimmage and has returned behind it. (d) A forward pass thrown after there has been a change of possession.  Item 2. Intercepted Illegal Pass. If an illegal pass is caught or intercepted, the ball may be advanced and the penalty declined.  Penalties: (a)  For a forward pass from beyond the line: Loss of down and five yards from the spot of the pass. See S.N. below. (b)  For a second forward pass from behind the line, or for a forward pass that was thrown after the ball returned behind the line: Loss of down and five yards from the previous spot. (c)  For a forward pass that is thrown after a change of possession: Loss of five yards from the spot of the pass.  Notes: (1) Eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules apply when a forward pass is thrown from behind the line, regardless of whether the pass is an illegal forward pass. Eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules do not apply if a forward pass is thrown (a) from beyond the line, (b) on a Free Kick play, (c) on a Fair Catch kick play, or (d) after a change of possession. (2) Roughing the passer rules apply on all passes (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line of scrimmage (12-2-9). If a pass is thrown from beyond the line of scrimmage, unnecessary roughness may apply for action against the passer. (3) When a distance penalty in Penalty (a) leaves the ball in advance of the necessary line to gain, it is first-and-10 for the offensive team. (4) See 3-2-4 for the definition of team possession during a forward pass (a loose ball), or for when possession ends.  ARTICLE 3.

A player who makes a catch may advance the ball. A forward pass is complete (by the offense) or intercepted (by the defense) in the field of play, at the sideline, or in the end zone if a player, who is inbounds: (a) secures control of the ball in his hands or arms prior to the ball touching the ground; and (b) touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; and (c) after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, performs any act common to the game (e.g., tuck the ball away, extend it forward, take an additional step, turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent), or he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so.   Notes: (1) Movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control. (2) If a player, who satisfied (a) and (b), but has not satisfied (c), contacts the ground and loses control of the ball, it is an incomplete pass if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out of bounds.

Note: If there is any question whether a forward pass is complete, intercepted, or incomplete, it is to be ruled incomplete.  ARTICLE 5.  ELIGIBLE RECEIVERS. The following players are eligible to catch a forward pass that is thrown from behind the line of scrimmage. (a) Defensive players. (b) Offensive players who are on either end of the line, provided they either have the numbers of eligible players (1\u201349 and 80\u201389) or have legally reported to play a position on the end of the line. See 5-1-2. (c) Offensive players who are legally at least one yard behind the line at the snap, provided they either have the numbers of eligible players (1\u201349 and 80\u201389) or have legally reported to play a position in the backfield.  (d) All offensive players after the ball has been touched by any defensive player or any eligible offensive player.  ARTICLE 6.  INELIGIBLE RECEIVERS. All offensive players other than those identified in Article 5 above are ineligible to catch a legal or illegal forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage, including: (a) Players who are not on either end of their line or at least one yard behind it when the ball is snapped. (b) Offensive players wearing numbers 50\u201379, unless they have reported a change in their eligibility status to the Referee and have assumed a position on the end of their line or in their backfield as required by Article 5;  (c) Players who fail to notify the Referee of being eligible when required; (d) An eligible receiver who has been out of bounds prior to or during a pass, even if he has re-established himself inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands.  Exception: If an eligible receiver is forced out of bounds by a foul by a defender, including illegal contact, defensive holding, or defensive pass interference, provided he attempts to return inbounds immediately, he becomes eligible to legally touch the pass (without prior touching by another eligible receiver or defender) as soon as he re-establishes himself inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands. See Article 8, Note 3.  (e) A player who takes his stance behind center as a T-formation quarterback is not an eligible receiver unless, before the ball is snapped, he legally moves to a position at least one yard behind the line of scrimmage or on the end of the line, and is stationary in that position for at least one second before the snap.  Note: If he leaves his position behind the center and does not receive the snap, it is Illegal Motion unless he has been stationary for at least one full second prior to the snap.   ARTICLE 7.  LEGAL TOUCHING. A forward pass (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line may be touched by any eligible player. A pass in flight may be tipped, batted, or deflected in any direction by any eligible player at any time, including such a pass in the end zone.  ARTICLE 8.  ILLEGAL TOUCHING OF A FORWARD PASS. It is a foul for illegal touching if a forward pass (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line of scrimmage: (a) is first touched intentionally or is caught by an originally ineligible offensive player; or  Penalty: Loss of five yards at the previous spot.   (b) first touches or is caught by an eligible offensive receiver who has gone out of bounds, either of his own volition or by being legally forced out of bounds, and has re-established himself inbounds.  Penalty: Loss of down at the previous spot.   Notes: (1) If a forward pass (legal or illegal) is caught by an ineligible offensive player, the ball remains alive.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4296, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e32ec924-5475-4399-9bf0-bc11aeeab3aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "e32ec924-5475-4399-9bf0-bc11aeeab3aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "afa8ac9d-6eee-4fac-999f-893f5c5e34dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "f086e515857b9dd1cf237ba77ffe36bb19e4b6087dedc1216ddae40e06de81fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "42e49fbd-526b-4e59-8a97-5d1ee8a6031c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "37fb57c08f8e7231626eab9abb8e468b1ed66d3af111163086740d96e336dd94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5593143f-4094-4f5e-88dd-b1f24420a0a9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c2a8408e099eef6bf6ad532896617d0501067b5e57a518664a1fadc60f94578b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A pass in flight may be tipped, batted, or deflected in any direction by any eligible player at any time, including such a pass in the end zone.

(b) first touches or is caught by an eligible offensive receiver who has gone out of bounds, either of his own volition or by being legally forced out of bounds, and has re-established himself inbounds.

(3) If a player touches the ball after having been out of bounds, but prior to re-establishing himself inbounds with both feet or any part of his body other than his hands, the pass is incomplete, and there is no penalty for illegal touching.  SECTION 2 INTENTIONAL GROUNDING ARTICLE 1.  DEFINITION. It is a foul for intentional grounding if a passer, facing an imminent loss of yardage because of pressure from the defense, throws a forward pass without a realistic chance of completion. A realistic chance of completion is defined as a pass that is thrown in the direction of and lands in the vicinity of an originally eligible offensive receiver.  Item 1. Passer or Ball Outside Tackle Position. Intentional grounding will not be called when a passer, who is outside, or has been outside, the tackle position, throws a forward pass that lands at or beyond the line of scrimmage, even if no offensive player(s) have a realistic chance to catch the ball (including when the ball lands out of bounds over the sideline or endline). If the ball crosses the line of scrimmage (extended) beyond the sideline, there is no intentional grounding. If a loose ball leaves the area bordered by the tackles, this area no longer exists; if the ball is recovered, all intentional grounding rules apply as if the passer is outside this area.  Item 2. Physical Contact. Intentional grounding should not be called if: 32", "start_char_idx": 3473, "end_char_idx": 5829, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5593143f-4094-4f5e-88dd-b1f24420a0a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "5593143f-4094-4f5e-88dd-b1f24420a0a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "595888d5-7cdf-468e-a461-c51b8bf5ba3e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "cd002b4e41c3a942c1afa471ead1653eaa8b5dc30db7cb47c77776e9c1b6d831", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e32ec924-5475-4399-9bf0-bc11aeeab3aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "c051913b04d6523790dd82cb8fee7726e225d5c89f95d086e93021f1b5d52f5d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "809cd691-bf23-4c44-91b5-20c6e183ffcb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d2a274b1b3a74ff6096d8c09eb2e6e6f5f3feb91236d3f4dbfd443c2cd08af4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rule 8 \n (a) the passer initiates his passing motion toward an eligible receiver and then is significantly affected by physical contact from a defensive player that causes the pass to land in an area that is not in the direction and vicinity of an eligible receiver; or (b) the passer is out of the pocket, and his passing motion is significantly affected by physical contact from a defensive player that causes the ball to land short of the line of scrimmage.  Item 3. Stopping Clock. A player under center is permitted to stop the game clock legally to save time if, immediately upon receiving the snap, he begins a continuous throwing motion and throws the ball directly into the ground.  Item 4. Delayed Spike. A passer, after delaying his passing action for strategic purposes, is prohibited from throwing the ball to the ground in front of him, even though he is under no pressure from defensive rusher(s).  Penalty: For intentional grounding:  (a) loss of down and 10 yards from the previous spot; or (b) loss of down at the spot of the pass; or  (c) if the passer is in his end zone when the ball is thrown, it is a safety. See 4-7 for actions to conserve time inside two minutes of either half.  Note: If the foul occurs less than 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage, but more than half the distance to the goal line, the ball is to be placed at the spot of the pass.  SECTION 3 INELIGIBLE PLAYER DOWNFIELD ARTICLE 1.  LEGAL AND ILLEGAL ACTS. On a scrimmage play during which a legal forward pass is thrown, an ineligible offensive player, including a T-formation quarterback, is not permitted to move more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage before the pass has been thrown.   Item 1. Legally Downfield. An ineligible player is not illegally downfield if, after initiating contact with an opponent within one yard of the line of scrimmage during his initial charge:  (a) he moves more than one yard beyond the line while legally blocking or being blocked by an opponent (b) after breaking legal contact with an opponent more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage, he remains stationary until a forward pass is thrown (c) after losing legal contact with an opponent more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage, he is forced behind the line of scrimmage by an opponent, at which time he is again subject to normal blocking restrictions for an ineligible offensive player.  Note: If an ineligible offensive player moves beyond the line while legally blocking or being blocked by an opponent, an eligible offensive player may catch a pass between them and the line of scrimmage.  Item 2. Illegally Downfield. An ineligible offensive player is illegally downfield if: (a) he moves more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage without contacting an opponent (b) after losing contact with an opponent within one yard of the line of scrimmage, he advances more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage (c) after losing contact with an opponent more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage, he continues to move toward his opponent\u2019s goal line.  Penalty: For ineligible offensive player downfield: Loss of five yards from the previous spot.  Note: An ineligible offensive player is illegally downfield when his entire body is more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage.  ARTICLE 2.  AFTER PASS IS THROWN. After the ball leaves the passer\u2019s hand, ineligible pass receivers can advance more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage, or beyond the position reached by their initial charge, provided that they do not block or contact a defensive player, who is more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage, until the ball is touched by a player of either team. Such prior blocking and/or contact is pass interference if it occurs in the vicinity of where the ball is thrown. See 8-3-1-Note above for exception when blocker maintains continuous contact.  SECTION 4 LEGAL AND ILLEGAL CONTACT WITH ELIGIBLE RECEIVERS ARTICLE 1.  LEGAL CONTACT WITHIN FIVE YARDS. Within the area five yards beyond the line of scrimmage, a defensive player may chuck an eligible receiver in front of him. The defender is allowed to maintain continuous and unbroken contact within the five-yard zone, so long as the receiver has not moved beyond a point that is even with the defender.  ARTICLE 2.

Within the area five yards beyond the line of scrimmage, a defensive player may chuck an eligible receiver in front of him. The defender is allowed to maintain continuous and unbroken contact within the five-yard zone, so long as the receiver has not moved beyond a point that is even with the defender.  ARTICLE 2.  ILLEGAL CONTACT WITHIN FIVE YARDS. Within the five-yard zone, if the player who receives the snap remains in the pocket with the ball, a defender may not make original contact in the back of a receiver, nor may he maintain contact after the receiver has moved beyond a point that is even with the defender.  Note: If a defender contacts a receiver within the five-yard zone of the line of scrimmage, loses contact, and then contacts him again within the five-yard zone, it is a foul for illegal contact.  ARTICLE 3.  ILLEGAL CONTACT BEYOND FIVE-YARD ZONE. Beyond the five-yard zone, if the player who receives the snap remains in the pocket with the ball, a defender cannot initiate contact with a receiver who is attempting to evade him. A defender may use his hands or arms only to defend or protect himself against impending contact caused by a receiver.  Note: If a defender contacts a receiver within the five-yard zone and maintains contact with him, he must release the receiver as they exit the five-yard zone. If the defender maintains contact beyond five yards, it is illegal contact.  ARTICLE 4.  INCIDENTAL CONTACT BEYOND FIVE-YARD ZONE. Beyond the five-yard zone, incidental contact may exist between receiver and defender.   33", "start_char_idx": 3694, "end_char_idx": 5550, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa324363-3128-464f-ae8a-21fcacee6132": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa324363-3128-464f-ae8a-21fcacee6132", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8f7c4d44-4d9f-41b1-838d-459e57f841fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "571aba685cc972b61e5a9096df059459f315884a911f2ef3587bc997b5f376bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "809cd691-bf23-4c44-91b5-20c6e183ffcb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "a31c30ef5bb0e1a6daa61bf8b853b05fb65fdf084876dd567972424c9219379b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "265127f4-afe2-4f92-9bfd-67b371d7ae4b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b85e3fcfbe1d655290fe24f841fe8f89addcfc3c1073c56793fef7e5b66a487b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rule 8 \n Penalty: For illegal contact by the defense: Loss of five yards and automatic first down.   ARTICLE 5.  ILLEGAL CUT BLOCK. It is an Illegal Cut Block if:  (a) an eligible receiver who takes a position more than two yards outside of his own tackle (flexed receiver) is blocked below the waist at, behind, or beyond the line of scrimmage; or (b) an eligible receiver who is lined up within two yards of the tackle, whether on or behind the line, is blocked below the waist after he goes beyond the line of scrimmage (such players may be blocked below the waist at or behind the line of scrimmage).   Penalty: For illegal cut block: Loss of 15 yards and automatic first down.   ARTICLE 6.  DEFENSIVE HOLDING. It is defensive holding if a player grasps an eligible offensive player (or his jersey) with his hands, or extends an arm or arms to cut off or encircle him. See 12-1-6.  Penalty: For holding by the defense: Loss of five yards and automatic first down.  Note: Any offensive player who pretends to possess the ball, and/or one to whom a teammate pretends to give the ball, may be tackled until he crosses the line of scrimmage between the offensive tackles of a normal tight offensive line.  ARTICLE 7.  END OF RESTRICTIONS. If the quarterback or the receiver of the snap demonstrates no further intention to pass the ball (i.e., hands off or pitches the ball to another player, throws a forward or backward pass, loses possession of the ball by a muff that touches the ground or a fumble, or if he is tackled) the restrictions on the defensive team prohibiting illegal contact, or an illegal cut block, against an eligible receiver will end, and a defensive player is permitted to use his hands, arms, or body to push, pull, or ward off an offensive receiver, pursuant to Rule 12, Section 1, Article 5. If the quarterback leaves the pocket area with the ball in his possession, the restrictions on illegal contact and an illegal cut block both end, but the restriction on defensive holding remains in effect.  If a team presents an apparent punting formation, defensive acts that normally constitute illegal contact (chuck beyond five yards, etc.) are permitted, provided that the acts do not constitute defensive holding.  SECTION 5 PASS INTERFERENCE ARTICLE 1.  DEFINITION. It is pass interference by either team when any act by a player more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage significantly hinders an eligible player\u2019s opportunity to catch the ball. Pass interference can only occur when a forward pass is thrown from behind the line of scrimmage, regardless of whether the pass is legal or illegal, or whether it crosses the line.   Defensive pass interference rules apply from the time the ball is thrown until the ball is touched. See Article 2 for prohibited acts while the ball is in the air.  Offensive pass interference rules apply from the time the ball is snapped until the ball is touched. See Article 2 for prohibited acts while the ball is in the air and Article 4 for prohibited acts prior to the pass.  ARTICLE 2.  PROHIBITED ACTS BY BOTH TEAMS WHILE THE BALL IS IN THE AIR. Acts that are pass interference include, but are not limited to: (a) Contact by a player who is not playing the ball that restricts the opponent\u2019s opportunity to make the catch; (b) Playing through the back of an opponent in an attempt to make a play on the ball; (c) Grabbing an opponent\u2019s arm(s) in such a manner that restricts his opportunity to catch a pass; (d) Extending an arm across the body of an opponent, thus restricting his ability to catch a pass, and regardless of whether the player committing such act is playing the ball; (e) Cutting off the path of an opponent by making contact with him, without playing the ball; (f) Hooking an opponent in an attempt to get to the ball in such a manner that it causes the opponent\u2019s body to turn prior to the ball arriving; or (g) Initiating contact with an opponent by shoving or pushing off, thus creating separation.  Note: If there is any question whether player contact is incidental, the ruling should be no interference.  ARTICLE 3.

If there is any question whether contact is incidental, the ruling shall be no interference. (b) Inadvertent tangling of feet when both players are playing the ball or neither player is playing the ball.

(d) Laying a hand on an opponent that does not restrict him in an attempt to make a play on the ball. (e) Contact by a player who has gained position on an opponent in an attempt to catch the ball.  Notes: (1) When the ball is in the air, eligible offensive and defensive receivers have the same right to the path of the ball and are subject to the same restrictions. (2) Acts that do not occur more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage are not pass interference, but could be offensive or defensive holding (see 12-1-3 and 12-1-6). (3) Whenever a team presents an apparent punting formation and until the ball is kicked, defensive acts that normally constitute pass interference are permitted against the end man on the line of scrimmage, or against an eligible receiver behind the line of scrimmage who is aligned or in motion more than one yard outside the end man on the line, provided that the acts do not constitute illegal holding. Defensive holding, such as tackling a receiver, still can be called and result in a five-yard penalty from the previous spot, if accepted.

OTHER PROHIBITED ACTS BY THE OFFENSE. Blocking more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage by an offensive player prior to a pass being thrown is offensive pass interference. See 8-3-1-Item 1 for exception for an ineligible offensive player.  Note: It is also pass interference by the offense to block a defender beyond the line while the pass is in the air, if the block occurs in the vicinity of the player to whom the pass is thrown. See 8-3-1-Note for exception for ineligible players.  Penalty: For pass interference by the defense: First down for the offensive team at the spot of the foul. If the interference is also a personal foul (12-2), the 15-yard penalty for such a foul is also enforced, either from the spot of the foul (for interference), or from the end of the run if the foul for pass interference is declined. If the interference is behind the defensive goal line, it is first down for the offensive team on the defense\u2019s one-yard line, or, if the previous spot was inside the two-yard line, halfway between the previous spot and the goal line.  Penalty: For pass interference by the offense: Loss of 10 yards from the previous spot.  SECTION 6 ENFORCEMENT SPOT ARTICLE 1.  ENFORCEMENT SPOT. If there is a foul by either team from the time of the snap until a forward pass thrown from behind the line ends, the penalty is enforced from the previous spot. A pass play ends and a running play begins at the instant that a pass is caught.  Exceptions:  (a) Pass interference by the defense is enforced from the spot of the foul. If it occurs in the fouling team\u2019s end zone, the ball will be placed at the one-yard line, or half the distance to the goal line from the previous spot, whichever is more beneficial to the offense.  (b) Intentional grounding is a loss of down at the spot of the foul, or a loss of down and a 10-yard penalty from the previous spot, whichever is less beneficial for the offense. See 8-2-1-Penalty.  (c) If there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the defense prior to completion of a forward pass thrown from behind the line, enforcement is from the previous spot or the dead-ball spot, whichever is more beneficial to the offense. If the play results in a score for the offense, enforcement is on the ensuing kickoff or Try. If the passing team is fouled and subsequently loses possession after a completion, the passing team retains possession of the ball, and enforcement is from the previous spot.  (d) If there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense prior to an interception of a forward pass thrown from behind the line, enforcement is from the dead-ball spot. If the intercepting team subsequently loses possession, the penalty is enforced from the spot of the interception, and the intercepting team retains possession.  (e) It is a safety when the offensive team commits a foul behind its own goal line.  Note: When the dead-ball spot is normally a touchback, enforcement is from the 20-yard line.  SECTION 7 BACKWARD PASS AND FUMBLE ARTICLE 1.  BACKWARD PASS. A runner may throw a backward pass at any time (3-22-5). Players of either team may advance after catching a backward pass, or recovering a backward pass after it touches the ground.  Exception: See actions to conserve time (4-7-1).  Note: A direct snap from center to a player in the backfield, a muffed hand-to-hand snap, or a snap that is untouched by any player are backward passes, and the ball remains alive. ARTICLE 2.  BACKWARD PASS OUT OF BOUNDS. If a backward pass goes out of bounds between the goal lines, the ball is dead (7-6-2-a), and it is next put in play at the inbounds spot. Rule 11 governs if a backward pass is declared dead behind the goal line.  ARTICLE 3.  FUMBLE. A fumble is any act, other than a pass or kick, which results in a loss of player possession.  Exception: If a runner intentionally fumbles forward, it is a forward pass (3-22).  Item 1. Recovery and Advance. Any player of either team may recover or catch a fumble and advance, either before or after the ball strikes the ground.

During a scrimmage kick that crosses the line of scrimmage, and prior to the end of the kick, it is a foul if a kicking team player goes out of bounds voluntarily (without being contacted by a receiving team player) to avoid a block by a receiving team player.  Penalty: Loss of five yards.  If a member of the kicking team is forced out of bounds, or goes out of bounds voluntarily, and does not attempt to return inbounds in a reasonable amount of time, it is a foul for Unsportsmanlike Conduct.

Any touching of the ball behind the line of scrimmage by a kicking team player is legal, even if the ball has crossed the line and returns behind the line.  ARTICLE 2.  FIRST TOUCHING BEYOND THE LINE. \u201cFirst touching\u201d is when a player of the kicking team touches a scrimmage kick in the field of play that is beyond the line of scrimmage before it has been touched by a player of the receiving team beyond the line. If the ball is first touched by a player of the kicking team, it remains in play. First touching is a violation, and the receivers shall have the option of taking possession of the ball at the spot of first touching, provided no live-ball penalty is accepted on the play, or at the spot where the ball is dead. First touching does not offset a foul by the receivers; if there is a live-ball foul by the receivers that is enforced, either before or after the first touching violation, the violation is disregarded, and the penalty is enforced as customary.  Notes: (1) If the receiving team gains possession, subsequently loses possession, and fouls after the kicking team gains possession, the spot of first touching is disregarded, and the kicking team retains possession. Enforcement of the receiving team\u2019s foul is as customary. (2) There may be multiple \u201cfirst touch\u201d spots if the kicking team touches the ball multiple times before it is touched by a player of the receiving team. (3) A Team B player is deemed not to have touched a kick if such touching occurs in the immediate vicinity of the line in an attempt to block the kick. (4) If a player of the kicking team touches the goal line with any part of his body while touching the ball, the ball is dead, and the result of the play is a touchback. (5) The spot of first touching is normally the yard line at which the ball is when touched. If the first touching occurs while the ball is in the air above or beyond the goal line, and prior to the ball touching the goal line or the ground beyond the goal line, the spot of first touching is deemed to be the spot from which the touching player left the field of play, but in no event inside the receiving team\u2019s one-yard line.  ARTICLE 3.  KICKING TEAM PLAYER OUT OF BOUNDS. A player of the kicking team, who has gone out of bounds during the kick, either of his own volition or by being legally forced out of bounds, may not touch or recover a scrimmage kick beyond the line of scrimmage until it has been touched by a kicking team player who has not been out of bounds, or until it has been touched by a player of the receiving team beyond the line.  Note: If a player touches or recovers the ball before he has re-established himself inbounds, the ball is out of bounds at the spot of the touch, and there is no foul.  Penalty: For illegal touching of a scrimmage kick: Loss of five yards. If the illegal touching is inside the receiver\u2019s five-yard line, in addition to the other specified options, the receiving team may elect to take a touchback.  ARTICLE 4.  BLOCKED INTO KICK. There is no distinction between a player touching a ball or being touched by it, but a player is not considered to have touched the ball if he is blocked into it by an opponent, provided he is in a passive position and not blocking. A player who is engaged with and blocking his opponent when he contacts the ball is deemed to have touched the ball.  ARTICLE 5.

In the event of such a catch or recovery, it is first-and-10 for the kickers, or if the ball is caught or recovered by the kickers in the receiver\u2019s end zone, it is a touchdown for the kickers. (7-3-1-d)  Item 2. Illegal Catch or Recovery. If the kickers catch or recover a kick beyond the line that has not been touched beyond the  line by the receiving team, the ball is dead, and it is first-and-10 for the receivers at the spot of catch or recovery (see 11-4-2 for missed goals). If a kick from behind the line is touched by the receiving team behind the line, such touching does not make the kicking team eligible to catch or recover the kick beyond the line.  Item 3. Touchback. If a player of the kicking team illegally catches or recovers a scrimmage kick, other than a field-goal attempt from beyond the 20-yard line, and touches the goal line with any part of his body while in possession of the ball, the ball is dead, and the result of the play is a touchback. For a missed field goal from beyond the 20-yard line, see 11-4-2.  ARTICLE 3.  RECEIVERS CATCH OR RECOVERY. If the receivers catch or recover any kick, they may advance. For fair catch exception, see 10-2. For exception for a ball that has crossed the goal line, see 9-4-1.  ARTICLE 4.  SIMULTANEOUS CATCH OR RECOVERY. When a legal kick is simultaneously caught or recovered anywhere by two eligible opposing players, or if the ball is lying on the field of play with no player attempting to recover it, it is awarded to the receivers.

If a scrimmage kick crosses the receiver\u2019s goal line from the impetus of the kick, the following shall apply: (a) If the ball has not been touched by a player of the receiving team beyond the line of scrimmage, it is dead immediately, and the result of the play is a touchback, when:  (1) it touches the ground on or behind the receiver\u2019s goal line; (2) it touches a player of the kicking team who is touching the ground on or behind the receiver\u2019s goal line; or (3) it touches a player of the kicking team who has touched the ground on or behind the receiver\u2019s goal line and has not re-established himself in the field of play. See 11-4-2 for options for missed field goals beyond the 20-yard line. (b) If the receivers catch the ball in the end zone, or recover it in the end zone after touching it in the field of play or the end zone, they may advance. (c) If the kickers catch or recover the ball in the end zone after the receivers first touch the ball in the field of play or the end zone, it is a touchdown for the kickers. (d) If there is a spot of first touching by the kickers outside the receivers\u2019 20-yard line, the receiving team has the option to take possession of the ball at the spot of the first touching. (e) If the scrimmage kick is a punt, and the ball goes out of bounds in the field of play after being touched by a receiver in the end zone or in the field of play, it is the receiving team\u2019s ball at the out-of-bounds spot.

BALL OUT OF BOUNDS OR NOT RECOVERED IN FIELD OF PLAY.

SECTION 5  SPOTS OF ENFORCEMENT ARTICLE 1.  SPOTS OF ENFORCEMENT. If there is a foul from the time of the snap until a legal scrimmage kick ends, enforcement is from the previous spot. This includes a foul during a run prior to a legal kick, and a foul by the kicking team during a missed field-goal attempt.  Exceptions: (1) If the offensive team commits a foul in its own end zone, it is a safety. (2) Unless the kick is a missed field-goal attempt, if there is a foul by the kicking team, the receiving team will have the option of taking the penalty at the previous spot and replaying the down, or adding the penalty yardage on to the dead-ball spot.  Notes: (a) The dead-ball spot for scrimmage kicks that result in a touchback is the 20-yard line. (b) If there is a foul for an illegal touch inside the five-yard line, the receiving team also has the option of accepting a touchback. (c) If there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the kicking team during a missed field-goal attempt where the receiving team is awarded the ball (see 11-4-2), enforcement is from the succeeding spot.  (3) Fair-catch interference, interference with the opportunity to make a catch, an invalid fair-catch signal, or a personal foul (blocking) after a fair-catch signal are enforced from the spot of the foul.  Note: If the foul is not part of a double foul and the opponent has possession at the end of the down, the foul may be enforced from the dead-ball spot. See 14-2-4.   (4) Except for fouls that are committed in an attempt to block the kick (such as running into or roughing the kicker, defensive holding (pull-and-shoot), leverage, leaping, and pushing teammate(s) into the offensive formation), if the receiving team commits a foul after the kick crosses the line of scrimmage, the penalty for its infraction will be enforced as if it had been 39", "start_char_idx": 3287, "end_char_idx": 5918, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d82cc05-d9c0-4f05-a8fe-09024a80d50a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d82cc05-d9c0-4f05-a8fe-09024a80d50a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6d34cbd-0e1e-4577-8d15-29e8e6f8ca13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "2b85a2da2dc7791d9f48569c26ae61d30e1efea30b6dc2916012aa1befe68e3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d80d0b69-86d2-419d-914a-2294e0207ece", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "d767a0898965556777c8b44d0ba4f0b6f94256b44d2d0747f561ab36329a45d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "90ed59f4-c782-4322-aba3-e6dadbec67c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6fa4bddfb9f8e7772d4a85980ba3638e0044c7799415dac6733738d1287fc2e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rule 9 in possession of the ball at the time the foul occurred (a post-possession foul), provided that the receiving team does not lose possession of the ball at any time during the down.

INTERFERENCE. During a scrimmage kick that crosses the line of scrimmage, or during a free kick, members of the kicking team are prohibited from interfering with any receiver making an attempt to catch the airborne kick, or from obstructing or hindering his path to the airborne kick, and regardless of whether any signal was given.  Item 1. Contact with Receiver. It is interference if a player of the kicking team contacts the receiver, or causes a passive player of either team to contact the receiver, before or simultaneous to the receiver touching the ball.  Item 2. Right of Way. A receiver who is moving toward a kicked ball that is in flight has the right of way. If opponents obstruct his path to the ball, or cause a passive player of either team to obstruct his path, it is interference, even if there is no contact, or if he catches the ball in spite of the interference, and regardless of whether any signal was given.  Note: It is not a foul if a kicking team player is blocked into the receiver, or the contact is the result of a foul.   Penalties: (a) For interference with the opportunity to make a catch when a prior signal has not been made: Loss of 15 yards from the spot of the foul, and the offended team is entitled to put the ball in play by a snap from scrimmage. See 4-8-2-d. (b) For interfering with a fair catch after a signal: Loss of 15 yards from the spot of the foul. A fair catch is awarded even if the ball is not caught. See 10-2-4.  Note: If the foul is not part of a double foul and the opponent has possession at the end of the down, the foul may be enforced from the dead-ball spot. See 14-2-4.  SECTION 2 FAIR CATCH ARTICLE 1.  DEFINITION. A Fair Catch is an unhindered catch of a scrimmage kick that has crossed the line of scrimmage and has not touched the ground, or of a free kick that has not touched the ground, by a player of the receiving team who has given a valid fair-catch signal.  ARTICLE 2.  FAIR-CATCH SIGNAL. Item 1. Valid Fair-Catch Signal. A fair-catch signal is valid if it is made while the kick is in flight by a player who fully extends one arm above his helmet and waves it from side to side. A receiver is permitted to legally raise his hand(s) to his helmet to shield his eyes from the sun, but is not permitted to raise them above his helmet except to signal for a fair catch.  Item 2. Invalid Fair-Catch Signal. If a player raises his hand(s) above his shoulder(s) in any other manner, it is an invalid fair-catch signal. If there is an invalid fair-catch signal, the ball is dead when caught or recovered by any player of the receiving team, but it is not a fair catch. (The ball is not dead if it touches an opponent before or after it strikes the ground. See Article 3-b).  Note: A fair-catch signal given behind the line of scrimmage on a scrimmage kick is ignored and is neither valid nor invalid.  Penalty: For an invalid fair-catch signal: Loss of five yards from the spot of the signal. If the foul occurs in Team B\u2019s end zone during a free kick, it is enforced from the previous spot.  Item 3. Muff. After a valid fair-catch signal, the opportunity to catch a kick does not end if the ball is muffed. A player who signaled for a fair catch must have a reasonable opportunity to catch the muffed ball before it hits the ground without interference by members of the kicking team, and regardless of whether the ball strikes another player or an official.  Penalty: For interference with the opportunity to make a fair catch after a muff: A fair catch is awarded at the spot of the interference even if the ball is not caught.  Item 4. Intentional Muff.

Penalty: For interference with the opportunity to make a fair catch after a muff: A fair catch is awarded at the spot of the interference even if the ball is not caught.  Item 4. Intentional Muff. An intentional muff forward prior to a catch in order to gain ground is an illegal bat (see 12-5-1-Note).  Item 5. Illegal Block.

(a) If a player of the receiving team makes a valid fair-catch signal, and the ball is not touched by a player of the kicking team, the following apply:  (1) If he catches the ball, it is dead immediately, and it is a fair catch. If he muffs the ball, but catches it before it touches the ground, it is also a fair catch. After a fair catch, the ball is next put in play by the receiving team at the dead-ball spot (or at the succeeding spot after enforcement of any applicable penalties). See Article 4.  (2) If he recovers the ball after it strikes the ground, it is dead immediately, but it is not a fair catch. (3) If the ball is caught or recovered by a teammate who did not make a valid fair-catch signal, the ball is dead immediately, but it is not a fair catch. The ball will next be put in play by a snap by the receiving team at the dead-ball spot (or at the succeeding spot after enforcement of any applicable penalties). (b) If the ball touches a player of the kicking team, before or after it strikes the ground, any player of the receiving team may catch or recover it and advance. If a player of the receiving team who has given a valid fair-catch signal catches the ball before it hits the ground and elects not to advance the ball, it is a fair catch. (c) If a receiver has made a fair catch, an opponent is prohibited from blocking or tackling him, or causing a passive player of either team to contact him. Incidental contact is not a foul.

WINNING TEAM. The team that scores the greater number of points during the entire game is the winner.  Note: If a team forfeits a game, the opponent will be declared the winner by a score of 2-0, but the points will not be added to the winning team\u2019s record for purposes of offensive production or tie-breakers.  ARTICLE 2.  TYPES OF SCORING PLAYS. Points are scored as follows: (a) Touchdown: 6 points (b) Field Goal: 3 points (c) Safety: 2 points (d) Try after touchdown: 1 point (Field Goal or Safety) or 2 points (Touchdown)  SECTION 2 TOUCHDOWN ARTICLE 1.  TOUCHDOWN PLAYS.

(2) If a player attempts to catch a pass, the ball is not dead, and a touchdown is not scored, until the receiver completes the catch. See 3-2-7.  SECTION 3 TRY  ARTICLE 1.  GENERAL RULES. After a touchdown, a Try is an opportunity for either team to score one or two additional points during one scrimmage down.  The Try begins when the Referee sounds the whistle for play to start. The team that scored the touchdown shall put the ball in play: (a) anywhere on or between the inbound lines; (b) 15 yards from the defensive team\u2019s goal line for a Try-kick; or (c) two yards from the defensive team\u2019s goal line for a Try by pass or run.   Notes:  (1) A team\u2019s choice is not final and is subject to change following a team timeout or accepted penalty. (2) All general rules for fumbles after the two-minute warning apply to the Try (See 8-7-6). (3) The Game Clock will not run during the Try. (4) If the ball has been declared ready for play by the Referee, and the offensive team wants to change the location of the ball, they can do so by calling a timeout. (5) See 9-1-3 for restriction applicable to Team B formation at the snap. (6) See 16-1-3-a for exception when a touchdown is scored in an overtime period, and 4-8-2-c when a touchdown is scored during a down in which time expires in the fourth period.  ARTICLE 2.  RESULTS OF A TRY. During a Try, the following shall apply: (a) If a kick results in a field goal by the offense, one point is awarded. An artificial or manufactured tee shall not be permitted to assist in the execution of a Try-kick. (The conditions of 11-4-1 must be met).  (b) If a Try results in a touchdown by either team, two points are awarded. (c) If the Try results in what would ordinarily be a safety against either team, one point is awarded to the opponent. (d) If any play results in a touchback, the Try is unsuccessful, and there shall be no replay.

The following applies if there is a foul by Team A: (a) If there is a foul by Team A during a successful Try, the Try shall be repeated, unless the penalty results in a loss of down. (b) If the penalty for a foul results in a loss of down, the Try is unsuccessful, and there shall be no replay.

If there is a foul by either team after a Try, it is enforced on the succeeding kickoff. If there are fouls by both teams, normal enforcement rules apply.  ARTICLE 4.  KICKOFF AFTER TRY. After a Try, the team on defense during the Try shall receive the kickoff (6-1-1-a).  SECTION 4 FIELD GOAL ARTICLE 1.  SUCCESSFUL FIELD GOAL. A field goal is scored when all of the following conditions are met: (a) The kick must be a placekick or dropkick made by the offense from on or behind the line of scrimmage or from the spot of a fair catch (fair-catch kick). If a fair catch is made or awarded outside the inbound line, the spot of the kick is the nearest inbound line. (b) After the ball is kicked, it must not touch the ground or any player of the offensive team before it passes through the goal. (c) The entire ball must pass through the vertical plane of the goal, which is the area above the crossbar and between the uprights or, if above the uprights, between their outside edges. If the ball passes through the goal, and returns through the goal without striking the ground or some object or person beyond the goal, the attempt is unsuccessful.

If there is a missed field-goal attempt, and the ball has not been touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, or in the end zone before the ball has touched the ground in the end zone, the following shall apply: (a) If the spot of the kick was inside the receivers\u2019 20-yard line, it is the receivers\u2019 ball at the 20-yard line or (b) If the spot of the kick was from the receivers\u2019 20-yard line or beyond the receivers\u2019 20-yard line, it is the receivers\u2019 ball at the spot of the kick.  Note: These options apply only if the scrimmage kick has crossed the line.  Exceptions: The special rules pertaining to field goals in (a) and (b) are not applicable, and all general rules for a scrimmage kick, other than penalty enforcements, will apply when there is a missed field goal and: (1) the ball is touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone before the ball has become dead; or (2) the scrimmage kick ends behind the line of scrimmage, and the ball has not been touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage.  Note: If a foul occurs during an unsuccessful field-goal attempt in (1) or (2) above, Rule 14-4-8 governs.  SUPPLEMENTAL NOTES: (1) If the receivers do not touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone, the ball is dead as soon as it touches the ground in the end zone, and it is the receivers\u2019 ball at the spot of the kick, or at the 20-yard line if the attempt was from inside the 20-yard line. 44", "start_char_idx": 3129, "end_char_idx": 5368, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1bf5364-c964-404b-9ace-743894b4cd28": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1bf5364-c964-404b-9ace-743894b4cd28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03e2a74d-ec8d-42f7-ac90-0ffb560a2ed2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "e3939140f0fd1b46fabc24f9765581ca467af9aa492ea6c83239424faf5ee666", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "18cf160d-e381-4f62-ac16-fec5a524e7d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "89ad42f2d93628a26110da6501f1c43601982d1b80352303555d425953f1bb5d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "30c896bc-3852-46de-9884-f7df20d86e96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3bb40a9113bfd6c3a1dc88f54e54dfdd9555a8602fe64124f66d367cadd719f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rule 11 (2) If the ball goes out of bounds after it is first touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, it is the receivers\u2019 ball at the out-of-bounds spot. (3) If the receivers first touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone, and the kickers recover, the ball belongs to the kickers at the spot of recovery. If the recovery is in the end zone, it is a touchdown. (4) If the receivers first touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, and without any new impetus, the ball rolls into the end zone where it is declared dead in the possession of the receivers, it is a touchback. (5) For a successful field goal, or for an unsuccessful attempt that does not land in the field of play, the maximum amount of time that can run off the game clock is five seconds.  ARTICLE 3.  FAIR-CATCH KICK. The rules for a field-goal attempt from scrimmage apply to a field-goal attempt following a Fair Catch (a Fair-Catch Kick).  Exceptions:  (1) The fair-catch kick line for the kicking team is the yard line through the most forward point from which the ball is kicked.  (2)  The fair-catch kick line for the receiving team is the yard line 10 yards in advance of the kicking team\u2019s fair-catch kick     line.  Note: Though a fair-catch kick is not a free kick, the rules for a free-kick formation apply (6-1-3). However, the kicking team cannot possess the ball unless it has first been touched or possessed by the receivers.  ARTICLE 4.  NO TEE. An artificial or manufactured tee shall not be permitted to assist in the execution of a field goal.  ARTICLE 5.  FOREIGN ARTICLES. No article of any type may be placed on the field, or used in any manner, to assist a player in the execution of a field goal and/or Try attempt.   ARTICLE 6.  BALL NEXT IN PLAY. After a field goal, the team scored upon will receive the kickoff. See 6-1-1-a.   SECTION 5 SAFETY ARTICLE 1.  SAFETY. It is a Safety: (a) when the defense accepts a penalty for a foul committed by the offense in its own end zone (see also 14-2-2-b) or; (b) when an impetus by a team sends the ball behind its own goal line, and the ball is dead in the end zone in its possession or the ball is out of bounds behind the goal line.  Exceptions: It is not a safety: (1) If a forward pass from behind the line of scrimmage is incomplete in the end zone.  (2) If a defensive player, in the field of play, intercepts a pass or catches or recovers a fumble, backward pass, scrimmage kick, free kick, or fair catch kick, and his original momentum carries him into his end zone where the ball is declared dead in his team\u2019s possession. The ball belongs to the defensive team at the spot where the player\u2019s foot or other body part touched the ground to establish possession. If that spot is in the end zone, the result of the play is a touchback, even if the ball is not on, above, or beyond the goal line. (11-6-1) (a) If a player of the team which intercepts, catches, or recovers the ball commits a live-ball foul in the end zone, it is a safety. (b) If a player who intercepts, catches, or recovers the ball throws a completed illegal forward pass from the end zone, the ball remains alive. If his opponent intercepts the illegal pass thrown from the end zone, the ball remains alive. If he scores, it is a touchdown. (c) If a player of the team which intercepts, catches, or recovers the ball commits a foul in the field of play, and the ball becomes dead in the end zone, the basic spot is the spot of the change of possession. (d) If the spot where possession changed is inside the one-yard line, the ball is to be spotted at the one-yard line.  Notes:  (1) A ball in the end zone which is carried toward the field of play is still in the end zone until the entire ball is in the field of play (3-12-4).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3842, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30c896bc-3852-46de-9884-f7df20d86e96": {"__data__": {"id_": "30c896bc-3852-46de-9884-f7df20d86e96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03e2a74d-ec8d-42f7-ac90-0ffb560a2ed2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "e3939140f0fd1b46fabc24f9765581ca467af9aa492ea6c83239424faf5ee666", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1bf5364-c964-404b-9ace-743894b4cd28", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "9b152e8ba3a7ad888450757b529397c551979dc039000133345dd96225fd1529", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "de2bf3f5-de7b-4d5c-b711-fb9c40c69fdd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8a1df3471108c3bb1227badb8680f746518177324797882c77bb675ad2d32b06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(b) If a player who intercepts, catches, or recovers the ball throws a completed illegal forward pass from the end zone, the ball remains alive.

Notes:  (1) A ball in the end zone which is carried toward the field of play is still in the end zone until the entire ball is in the field of play (3-12-4). (2) The impetus is always attributed to the offense, unless the defense creates a new force that sends the ball behind its own goal line by muffing a ball which is at rest or nearly at rest, or by batting or kicking any loose ball (3-17).  ARTICLE 2.  BALL IN PLAY AFTER SAFETY. After a safety, the team scored upon must put the ball in play by a free kick (punt, dropkick, or placekick) from its 20-yard line. An artificial or manufactured tee cannot be used. See 6-1-1-b and 6-1-3.  Exception: For extension of either half, see 4-8-2-g.  SECTION 6 TOUCHBACK Note: A touchback, while not a score, is included in this rule because, like scoring plays, it is a case of a ball that is dead on or behind a goal line.  ARTICLE 1.  DEFINITION. It is a Touchback if the ball is dead on or behind the goal line a team is defending, provided that the impetus comes from an opponent, and that it is not a touchdown or an incomplete forward pass.  Note: A ball in the end zone which is carried toward the field of play is still in the end zone until the entire ball is in the field of play (3-12-4).  ARTICLE 2.  TOUCHBACK SITUATIONS. When a team provides the impetus (3-17) that sends a loose ball behind its opponent\u2019s goal line, it is a touchback: (a) if the ball is dead in the opponent\u2019s possession in its end zone; (b) if the ball is out of bounds behind the goal line (see 8-7-3-Item 4-a); 45", "start_char_idx": 3082, "end_char_idx": 5232, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de2bf3f5-de7b-4d5c-b711-fb9c40c69fdd": {"__data__": {"id_": "de2bf3f5-de7b-4d5c-b711-fb9c40c69fdd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50f9736d-1504-48e3-ba46-9dcdfdba6d38", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "0d0810a141f4219c3ed3f839690d906cfa8dacee4ff54b140687a045f72eefc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "30c896bc-3852-46de-9884-f7df20d86e96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "a45cb4804783f1540b16a6839709b404309c8383c68d0758ef7cb872ae502182", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0fb311a8-3b7a-4304-9e57-195afbdda30f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e89a23bb30525295f1b65792c28aca51e7597249ebee34add190c5897479b04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rule 11 (c) if a scrimmage kick has not been touched by a player of the receiving team beyond the line of scrimmage, and the ball:  (1) touches the ground on or behind the receiver\u2019s goal line; (2)  touches a player of the kicking team who is touching the ground on or behind the receiver\u2019s goal line; or (3)  touches a player of the kicking team who has touched the ground on or behind the receiver\u2019s goal line and has not re-established himself in the field of play (see 11-4-2-b for exception for a missed field goal from beyond the 20-yard line).

Penalty: For illegal use of hands, arms, or body by the offense: Loss of 10 yards.     ARTICLE 2.  LEGAL BLOCK BY OFFENSIVE PLAYER. An offensive player is permitted to block an opponent by contacting him with his head, shoulders, hands, and/or outer surface of the forearm, or with any other part of his body that is not prohibited by another rule.  A blocker may use his arms, or open or closed hands, to contact an opponent on or outside the opponent\u2019s frame (the body of an opponent below the neck that is presented to the blocker), provided that he does not materially restrict him. The blocker must work immediately to bring his hands inside the opponent\u2019s frame, and as the play develops, the blocker is permitted to work for and maintain his position against an opponent, provided that he does not illegally clip or illegally push from behind.    An offensive player is permitted to use his hands or arms to restrict an opponent: (a)  If he is a runner. A runner may ward off opponents with his hands and arms. He may also lay his hand on a teammate or push him into an opponent, but he may not grasp or hold on to a teammate. (b) During a loose ball that has touched the ground. An offensive player may use his hands/arms legally to block or otherwise push or pull an opponent out of the way in a personal attempt to recover the ball. See specific fumble, pass, or kick rules and especially 6-2-1. (c)  A kicking team player.  See 6-2-1 and 9-1-4 for blocking restrictions during a kick.  ARTICLE 3.  ILLEGAL BLOCK BY OFFENSIVE PLAYER. It is a foul if an offensive blocker: (a) Thrusts his hands forward above the frame of an opponent to forcibly contact him on the head, neck, or face; or  Note: Contact in close-line play is not a foul, unless it is direct and forcible, or prolonged.  Penalty: For illegal use of hands by the offense: Loss of 10 yards.   (b) Blocks an opponent (from behind) in the back above the opponent\u2019s waist, or uses his hands or arms to push an opponent from behind in a manner that affects his movement, except in close-line play.

This does not apply to offensive blocking in close-line play where it is legal to clip above the knee(s), but it is illegal to clip at or below the knee(s). See 3-7, close-line play.  Exception: An offensive lineman may not clip a defender above the knees who, at the snap, is aligned on the line of scrimmage opposite another offensive lineman who is more than one position away, and the defender is responding to the flow of the ball away from the blocker.  Example: An offensive tackle cannot clip a defensive nose tackle on a sweep away.  Note: If there is a block from the side, or if an opponent turns his back as the block is being made, it is not clipping if the opponent is able to see or ward off the block, provided the blocker does not roll up on the back or side of the opponent\u2019s leg(s).  If an offensive player\u2019s block (legal or illegal) is followed by the blocker rolling up on the back or side of the leg(s) of a defender, it is clipping, including in close-line play.  When a blocker, who is moving in the same direction as an opponent, initially contacts the opponent on his side, and subsequently contacts the opponent below his waist from behind, it is not clipping if the contact is continuous.

An offensive player cannot initiate contact on the side and below the waist against an opponent if: (a) the blocker is moving toward his own end line; and (b) he approaches the opponent from behind or from the side.  Note: If the near shoulder of the blocker completely crosses the front of both of his opponent\u2019s legs, the block is legal.  Penalty: For a \u201cPeel Back\u201d Block: Loss of 15 yards.  ARTICLE 3. ILLEGAL CUT BLOCK. See 8-4-5.  ARTICLE 4. BLOCKING BELOW THE WAIST. Blocks below the waist are prohibited in the following situations: (a) By players of either team after a change of possession; or (b) By players of the kicking team after a Free Kick, Safety Kick, Fair-Catch Kick, Punt, Field-Goal Attempt, or Try Kick; (c) By players of the receiving team during a down in which there is a Free Kick, Safety Kick, Fair-Catch Kick, Punt, Field- Goal Attempt, or Try Kick; or (d) By players of either team during a scrimmage down prior to a change of possession unless the contact occurs in the Tight End Box. (Note: Players are prohibited from initiating contact below the waist of an opponent outside the Tight End Box, except against a runner or a player who is attempting to catch a forward or backward pass).  Note: The following blocking restrictions may result in a foul even if they occur in the Tight End Box: (i) Illegal cut block. See 8-4-5. (ii) Clipping. See 12-2-1. (iii) \u201cPeel Back\u201d Block. See 12-2-2. (iv) Chop Block. See 12-2-5. (v) Crackback Block. See 12-2-6.  Penalty: For illegally blocking below the waist: Loss of 15 yards.  ARTICLE 5.  CHOP BLOCK. All Chop Blocks are illegal.  A Chop Block is a high/low double-team block by the offense in which one offensive player (designated as A1 for purposes of this rule) blocks a defensive player in the area of the thigh or lower while another offensive player (A2) engages that same defensive player above the waist.  The order of the blocks is irrelevant.  Illegal Chop Blocks include, but are not limited to, the following situations:    (a) A1 chops a defensive player while the defensive player is physically engaged above the waist by the blocking attempt of A2. (b) A2 physically engages a defensive player above the waist with a blocking attempt, and A1 chops the defensive player after the contact by A2 has been broken and while A2 is still confronting the defensive player. (c) A1 chops a defensive player while A2 confronts the defensive player in a pass-blocking posture but is not physically engaged with the defensive player (a \u201clure\u201d). (d) A1 blocks a defensive player in the area of the thigh or lower, and A2, simultaneously or immediately after the block by A1, engages the defensive player high (\u201creverse chop\u201d). (e) A1 is lined up in the backfield at the snap and subsequently chops a defensive player engaged above the waist by A2.  (f) A1, an offensive lineman, chops a defensive player after the defensive player has been engaged by A2 (high or low).  Note: It is not a foul if the defender initiates the contact with the blocker, or if the blocker is trying to slip or escape from the defender, and any engagement with him is incidental.  Penalty: For Chop Block: Loss of 15 yards.  ARTICLE 6.  CRACKBACK BLOCK. All Crackback Blocks are illegal.   Item 1. Definition. It is a Crackback Block if the following conditions are fulfilled:  The block occurs within an area five yards on either side of the line of scrimmage, including within close-line play, by an offensive player who is moving toward the position from which the ball was snapped; and  (a) the offensive player was in a set position and aligned more than two yards outside an offensive tackle (flexed) when the ball was snapped; or (b) the offensive player was in a backfield position when the ball was snapped and moved to a position more than two yards outside an offensive tackle; or (c) the offensive player was in a backfield position and in motion when the ball was snapped.

A standard of strict liability applies for any contact against an opponent, even if his body position is in motion, and irrespective of any acts by him, such as ducking his head or curling up his body in anticipation of contact.

It is a foul if a player initiates a block when his path is toward or parallel to his own end line and makes forcible contact to his opponent with his helmet, forearm, or shoulder.  Note: It is not a foul for a blindside block if the forcible contact occurs in \u201cclose-line play\u201d prior to the ball leaving that area. The ball is not considered to have left that area if the player who takes the snap, either from a shotgun position or from under center, retreats in the pocket immediately or with a slight delay, and hands the ball to another player, or runs with the ball himself. This exception does not apply to any action other than a designed play. Any forcible contact in \u201cclose-line play\u201d is still subject to the restrictions for crackback and peel back blocks.

Players on defense are responsible for knowing when a runner has crossed the boundary line, except in doubtful cases where he might step on a boundary line and continue parallel with it.  (c) a player of the receiving team who has gone out of bounds and blocks a kicking team player out of bounds during the kick. If this occurs on a kick from scrimmage, post-possession rules will apply if appropriate (9-5-1);   (d) running, diving into, or throwing the body against or on a runner whose forward progress has been stopped, who has slid, or who has declared himself down by going to the ground untouched and has made no attempt to advance (see 7-2-1-a-d); (e) running, diving into, or throwing the body against or on any player on the ground either before or after the ball is dead; (f) throwing the runner to the ground after the ball is dead;  (g) unnecessarily running, diving into, cutting, or throwing the body against or on a player who (1) is out of the play or (2) should not have reasonably anticipated such contact by an opponent, before or after the ball is dead;   (h)   a kicker/punter, who is standing still or fading backward after the ball has been kicked, is out of the play and must not be unnecessarily contacted by the receiving team through the end of the down or until he assumes a distinctly defensive position. However, a kicker/punter is a defenseless player through the conclusion of the down (see 12-2-9-a-8); or (i) using any part of a player\u2019s helmet or facemask to butt, spear, or ram an opponent (Note: This provision does not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional tackle or block on an opponent).  Penalty: For unnecessary roughness: Loss of 15 yards. The player may be disqualified if the action is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant. If the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down.

It is an illegal launch if a player (i) leaves both feet prior to contact to spring forward and upward into his opponent, and (ii) uses any part of his helmet to initiate forcible contact against any part of his opponent\u2019s body. (This does not apply to contact against a runner, unless the runner is still considered to be a defenseless player, as defined in Article 9).  Notes: (1) The provisions of (b) do not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or helmet in the course of a conventional tackle or block on an opponent. (2) A player who initiates contact against a defenseless opponent is responsible for avoiding an illegal act. This includes illegal contact that may occur during the process of attempting to dislodge the ball from an opponent. A standard of strict liability applies for any contact against a defenseless opponent, even if the opponent is an airborne player who is returning to the ground or whose body position is otherwise in motion, and irrespective of any acts by the defenseless opponent, such as ducking his head or curling up his body in anticipation of contact.  Penalty: For unnecessary roughness: Loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down. The player may be disqualified if the action is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant.  ARTICLE 10.  USE OF THE HELMET. It is a foul if a player lowers his head and makes forcible contact with his helmet against an opponent.  Penalty: Loss of 15 yards. If the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down. The player may be disqualified.  ARTICLE 11.  ROUGHING THE PASSER. Because the act of passing often puts the quarterback (or any other player attempting a pass) in a position where he is particularly vulnerable to injury, special rules against roughing the passer apply. The Referee has principal responsibility for enforcing these rules. Any physical acts against a player who is in a passing posture (i.e. before, during, or after a pass) which, in the Referee\u2019s judgment, are unwarranted by the circumstances of the play will be called as fouls. The Referee will be guided by the following principles: (a) Roughing will be called if, in the Referee\u2019s judgment, a pass rusher clearly should have known that the ball had already left the passer\u2019s hand before contact was made; pass rushers are responsible for being aware of the position of the ball in passing situations; the Referee will use the release of the ball from the passer\u2019s hand as his guideline that the passer is now fully protected; once a pass has been released by a passer, a rushing defender may make direct contact with the passer only up through the rusher\u2019s first step after such release (prior to second step hitting the ground); thereafter the rusher must be making an attempt to avoid contact and must not continue to \u201cdrive through\u201d or otherwise forcibly contact the passer; incidental or inadvertent contact by a player who is easing up or being blocked into the passer will not be considered significant. (b) A rushing defender is prohibited from committing such intimidating and punishing acts as \u201cstuffing\u201d a passer into the ground or unnecessarily wrestling or driving him down after the passer has thrown the ball, even if the rusher makes his initial contact with the passer within the one-step limitation provided for in (a) above. When tackling a passer who is in a defenseless posture (e.g., during or just after throwing a pass), a defensive player must not unnecessarily or violently throw him down or land on top of him with all or most of the defender\u2019s weight. Instead, the defensive player must strive to fall to the side of the quarterback\u2019s body, or to brace his fall with his arms to avoid landing on the quarterback with all or most of his body weight. (c) In covering the passer position, Referees will be particularly alert to fouls in which defenders impermissibly use the helmet and/or facemask to hit the passer, or use hands, arms, or other parts of the body to hit the passer forcibly in the head or neck area (see also the other unnecessary roughness rules covering these subjects).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4584, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a855331-c95d-4860-82f5-f8b79c8f57ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a855331-c95d-4860-82f5-f8b79c8f57ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83172cf0-8c11-434d-a5b3-519e2326bf2d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "2472cc25fab740d95533be43bc4c6385852c164712d7b40abce689a7b459c7cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "306789a6-c2a4-4074-a768-d52d2b49ac8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "ba634cf4df7625c47a41d6fc1b1916a4b94259535f5209ef77afb8ef1c28e9af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "97faeb51-658e-4750-98cf-69f10d7d99fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "afb2275eec641659a94a78f2ec334f210947f24bfa210663bf368a4685de31ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "When tackling a passer who is in a defenseless posture (e.g., during or just after throwing a pass), a defensive player must not unnecessarily or violently throw him down or land on top of him with all or most of the defender\u2019s weight.

A defensive player must not use his helmet against a passer who is in a defenseless posture\u2014for example, (1) forcibly hitting the passer\u2019s head or neck area with the helmet or facemask, even if the initial contact of the defender\u2019s helmet or facemask is lower than the passer\u2019s neck, and regardless of whether the defensive player also uses his arms to tackle the passer by encircling or grasping him; or (2) lowering the head and making forcible contact with any part of the helmet against any part of the passer\u2019s body. This rule does not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional tackle on a passer.   (d) A rushing defender is prohibited from forcibly hitting in the knee area or below a passer who has one or both feet on the ground, even if the initial contact is above the knee. It is not a foul if the defender is blocked (or fouled) into the passer and has no opportunity to avoid him.  Notes: (1) A defender cannot initiate a roll or lunge and forcibly hit the passer in the knee area or below, even if he is being contacted by another player. (2)  It is not a foul if the defender swipes or grabs a passer in the knee area or below in an attempt to tackle him, provided he does not make forcible contact with the helmet, shoulder, chest, or forearm.  (e) A passer who is standing still or fading backward after the ball has left his hand is obviously out of the play and must not be unnecessarily contacted by an opponent through the end of the down or until the passer becomes a blocker, or a runner, or, in the event of a change of possession during the down, until he assumes a distinctly defensive position. However, at any time after the change of possession, it is a foul if:  (1) an opponent forcibly hits the quarterback\u2019s head or neck area with his helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder (2) if an opponent lowers his head and makes forcible contact with any part of his helmet against any part of the passer\u2019s body.

It is not a foul if the contact is not severe, or if the kicker returns both feet to the ground prior to the contact and falls over a defender on the ground  Note: When in doubt, it is a foul for roughing the kicker.  Item 2. Running into the Kicker. It is a foul for running into the kicker if a defensive player: (a) contacts the kicking leg or foot of the kicker, even if the kicker is airborne when the contact occurs; or (b) slides under the kicker, preventing him from returning both feet to the ground  Penalties:   (1) For roughing the kicker: Loss of 15 yards from the previous spot (personal foul) and an automatic first down.

NON-PLAYER FOULS. There shall be no unsportsmanlike conduct by a substitute, coach, attendant, or any other non-player (entitled to sit on a team\u2019s bench) during any period or timeout (including between halves).  Notes: (1) \u201cLoud speaker\u201d coaching from the sidelines is not permissible. (2) A player may communicate with a coach provided the coach is in his prescribed area during dead-ball periods. (3) It is impermissible for the grounds crew or other team personnel to clear away snow for a Try kick, field goal, punt, or kickoff.  ARTICLE 2. TEAM ATTENDANTS MAY ENTER FIELD DURING TIMEOUT. Either or both team attendants and their helpers may enter the field to attend to their team during a team timeout by either team. No other non-player may come on the field without the Referee\u2019s permission, unless he is an incoming substitute (5-2-2).  During any team timeout, all playing rules continue in force. Representatives of either team are prohibited from entering the field unless they are incoming substitutes, or team attendants or trainers entering to provide for the welfare of a player, and any game-type activities are prohibited on the field. The Head Coach may enter the field to check on the welfare of a player who is injured, but no assistant coach may enter the field.  ARTICLE 3.  BENCH CREDENTIALS. With the exception of uniformed players eligible to participate in the game, all persons in a team\u2019s bench area must wear a visible credential clearly marked \u201cBENCH.\u201d For all NFL games\u2014pre-season, regular season, and post-season the home club will be issued a maximum of 27 credentials and the visiting club will be issued a maximum of 25 credentials for use in its bench area. Such credentials must be worn by coaches, players under contract to the applicable club but ineligible to participate in the game, and team support personnel (trainers, doctors, equipment men). From time to time, persons with game services credentials (e.g., oxygen technicians, ball boys/girls) and authorized club personnel not regularly assigned to the bench area may be in a team\u2019s bench area for a brief period without bench credentials. Clubs are prohibited from allowing into their bench areas any persons who are not officially affiliated with the club or otherwise serving a necessary game day function.  ARTICLE 4.  RESTRICTED AREAS. All team personnel must observe the zone restrictions applicable to the bench area and the border rimming the playing field. The only persons permitted within the solid six-foot white border (1-1-2) while play is in progress on the field are game officials. For reasons involving the safety of participating players whose actions may carry them out of bounds, officials\u2019 unobstructed coverage of the game, and spectators\u2019 sightlines to the field, the border rules must be observed by all coaches and players in the bench area. Violators are subject to penalty by the officials.  ARTICLE 5.  MOVEMENT ON SIDELINES. Coaches and other non-participating team personnel (including uniformed players not in the game at the time) are prohibited from moving laterally along the sidelines any further than the points that are 18 yards from the middle of the bench area (i.e., 25-yard lines to left and right of bench areas when benches are placed on opposite sides of the field). Lateral movement within the bench area must be behind the solid six-foot white border.  Exception: When the ball is positioned near a goal line, a Head Coach may move laterally down the sideline outside the bench area to call a team timeout or challenge an on-field ruling.   ARTICLE 6.  NON-BENCH AREAS. Clubs are prohibited from allowing into the non-bench areas of field level any persons who have not been accredited to those locations by the home club\u2019s public relations office for purposes related to news media coverage, stadium operations, or pregame and halftime entertainment. The home club is responsible for keeping the field level cleared of all unauthorized persons. Photographers and other personnel accredited for field-level work must not be permitted in the end zones or any other part of the official playing field while play is in progress.

REFUSAL OF PENALTIES. Unless expressly prohibited, the penalty for any foul may be declined by the offended team, and play proceeds as though no foul had been committed. The yardage distance for any penalty may be declined, even though the penalty is accepted.  Note: If the defensive team commits a foul during an unsuccessful Try, the offensive team may decline the distance penalty, and the down is replayed from the previous spot.    Exception: If there is a Double Foul, enforcement is pursuant to Section 5 below.  Note: In all situations, a disqualified or suspended player must be removed, including when the foul that led to the disqualification or suspension is declined, a penalty for another foul is chosen (Multiple Foul), or fouls by both teams offset (Double Foul).  ARTICLE 2.  NUMBER OF DOWN AFTER PENALTY. Item 1. Foul by Team A. If the ball is behind the line to gain after the enforcement of a distance penalty for a foul by Team A that occurs prior to (between downs) or during a play from scrimmage, the number of the ensuing down remains the same, unless it is a combination penalty involving loss of down (see Item 2).  Item 2. Combination Penalty. A combination penalty involving both distance and loss of down is enforced for the following fouls:  (a)  A forward pass from beyond the line (8-1-2-Pen. a) (b)  A forward pass that is intentionally grounded (8-2-1) (c)  Handing the ball forward beyond the line of scrimmage (8-7-4) (d) Batting a Loose Ball (See 12-5-1-Pen.) (e)  Kicking a Loose Ball (See 12-5-2-Pen.)  If a loss-of-down penalty is enforced prior to fourth down, the number of the ensuing down is one greater than that of the previous down. If it is enforced on fourth down, the ball is awarded to Team B; if there is a combination penalty on fourth down, the distance penalty is also enforced.    Item 3. Line to Gain and Change of Possession. If a change (or multiple changes) of possession is negated by enforcement of a penalty against Team A during a play from scrimmage, the line to gain for Team A remains the same.  Item 4. Ball in Advance of Line to Gain. If the ball is in advance of the line to gain after the enforcement of a distance penalty for a foul by Team A during a play from scrimmage, it is first-and-10 for Team A. It is also first-and-10 after enforcement for a Dead Ball Foul (Section 4, Article 9) by Team A at the end of a play from scrimmage when there has not been a change of possession.  Exception: A foul against an official, regardless of when it occurs, is always treated as a Foul Between Downs. 12-3-1-e.  Item 5. Foul by Team B. After a penalty for a foul by Team B prior to (between downs) or during a play from scrimmage, the ensuing down is first-and-10 for Team A.   Exceptions:  (1) Offside.  (2) Encroachment.  (3) Neutral zone infraction.  (4) Delay of game.  (5) Illegal substitution.  (6) Excess time out.  (7) Running into the kicker.  (8) More than 11 players on the field at the snap.  (9) More than 11 players in the formation prior to the snap.  (10) Illegal formation by the defense during a scrimmage kick play.  For the above exceptions, the number of the down and the line to gain remain the same unless a distance penalty places the ball on or in advance of the line to gain, in which case it is first-and-10 for Team A.  Item 6. Foul After Change of Possession.

HALF-DISTANCE PENALTY. If the enforcement of a distance penalty would move the ball more than half the distance from the spot of enforcement to the offender\u2019s goal line, the penalty shall be half the distance from the spot of enforcement to its goal line. This general rule supersedes any other general or specific enforcement of a distance penalty.  Exceptions:   (1) See Rule 8-2-1 for enforcement for intentional grounding. (2) See Rule 12-3-4 for enforcement for a palpably unfair act.  ARTICLE 2.  FOUL BEHIND A GOAL LINE. (a) When the spot of enforcement for a foul by the defense is behind the offensive goal line, a distance penalty is enforced from the goal line. However, if the play results in a touchback, the penalty is enforced from the 20-yard line, or from the 25-yard line if the impetus was from a free kick. See Section 4, Article 6 for fouls during a backward pass or fumble and Section 4, Article 4 (b), Note, for exception when a player\u2019s momentum carries him into the end zone. (b) When the spot of enforcement for a foul by the offense is behind the offensive goal line, it is a safety. (c) When the spot of enforcement for a foul by the offense is behind the defensive goal line, a distance penalty is enforced from the goal line.  ARTICLE 3.  FOUL DURING A SCORE. If a team commits a personal or unsportsmanlike conduct foul, or a palpably unfair act, during a down in which the opponent scores, the penalty is enforced on the succeeding free kick (unless the score resulted from the enforcement). On a touchdown, the penalty, whether a live-ball or dead-ball foul or a foul between downs, may be enforced on the succeeding kickoff or Try. On a successful Try kick, any foul by Team B that does not result in a retry or negate a score may be enforced on the succeeding free kick.  Exception: If a personal foul, unsportsmanlike conduct foul, or a palpably unfair act occurs on a touchdown or successful field goal, the scoring team has the option to begin a new series or to replay the down following enforcement of the penalty from the previous spot, and the score does not count. On a successful Try kick, the scoring team has the option to replay the down following enforcement of the penalty from the previous spot or the other Try spot.  ARTICLE 4.  PERSONAL FOULS AND UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT FOULS. If any team commits a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul that is not part of a double foul, and the opponent has possession at the end of the down, enforcement may be from the dead-ball spot in addition to any other enforcement options provided by rule.  SECTION 3 SPOT FROM WHICH PENALTY IS ENFORCED ARTICLE 1.  GOVERNING PROVISIONS. The general provisions of Rule 14 govern all spots of enforcement, except for specific enforcements designated elsewhere in these rules.  ARTICLE 2.  FOUL BY NON-PLAYER. Penalties for fouls committed by non-players shall be enforced as provided for in Rule 13.    ARTICLE 3.  ENFORCEMENT SPOT NOT GOVERNED. When the spot of enforcement is not governed by a general or specific rule, it is the spot of the foul.  ARTICLE 4.  SPOTS OF ENFORCEMENT. The Spot of Enforcement is the spot at which a penalty is enforced. There are six spots that are commonly used:  (a)  The Previous Spot: The spot at which the ball was last put in play. (b) The Spot of the Foul: The spot at which a foul was committed or, by rule, is considered to have been committed. (c)  The Spot of a Backward Pass or a Fumble: The spot at which the backward pass or fumble occurred during the down in which there was a foul. (d)  The Dead Ball Spot: The spot at which the ball became dead. (e)  The Succeeding Spot: The spot at which the ball will next be put in play (i.e., the spot of the ball after enforcement for a foul, or, if there has been no foul, the spot at which the ball became dead). (f)  The Spot of a Change of Possession: The spot at which possession is gained by or awarded to the opponent.

The Basic Spot is a reference point that is used to determine the Spot of Enforcement for fouls committed pursuant to the Three-and-One Method of Enforcement. It is applicable for fouls committed during (i) a running play or (ii) a backward pass or fumble.  (a) For fouls committed during a running play which is not followed by a change of possession, the Basic Spot is the dead-ball spot. (b) For fouls committed during a running play which is followed by a change of possession, the Basic Spot is the spot where possession is lost. (c) For fouls committed during a backward pass or fumble, the Basic Spot is the spot of the backward pass or the spot of the fumble.  ARTICLE 6.  THREE-AND-ONE METHOD OF ENFORCEMENT. For fouls committed during a run, a backward pass, or a fumble, the penalty is enforced from the Basic Spot if: (a) the defense fouls in advance of the Basic Spot; (b) the defense fouls behind the Basic Spot; or (c) the offense fouls in advance of the Basic Spot.  If the offense fouls behind the Basic Spot, enforcement is from the spot of the foul (three-and-one method of enforcement).  Exceptions for fouls committed by the offense: (1) Fouls committed by the offense behind the line of scrimmage, except for fouls committed in the end zone, are enforced from the previous spot.

(4) If the offense commits a foul in the defense\u2019s end zone prior to scoring a touchdown, enforcement is from the goal line.  Exception for fouls committed by the defense: (1) When the Basic Spot is behind the line of scrimmage, and the defense has committed a foul either behind or beyond the line of scrimmage, the penalty is enforced from the previous spot.   SECTION 4 SPOTS OF ENFORCEMENT ARTICLE 1.  FOUL BEFORE OR AT THE SNAP. Item 1. Before the Snap. A foul that occurs prior to the snap is enforced from the succeeding spot, and the down remains the same, unless enforcement of the foul results in a first down.    Item 2. At the Snap. A foul that occurs at the snap is enforced from the previous spot, and the down is repeated, unless enforcement of the foul results in a first down.  ARTICLE 2.  FOUL COMMITTED DURING RUNNING PLAY. For a foul committed during a running play when there is not a subsequent change of possession during the down, the Basic Spot is the dead-ball spot. The three-and-one method of enforcement is used (see Section 3, Article 6).  Note: A foul during a run prior to a forward pass or kick from behind the line is enforced as a foul during a passing play or during a scrimmage kick.      ARTICLE 3.  FOUL COMMITTED DURING RUNNING PLAY BEFORE CHANGE OF POSSESSION. When a foul occurs during a running play, and the run in which the foul occurs is followed by a change of possession, the Basic Spot is the spot where possession is lost. The three-and-one method of enforcement is used (see Section 3, Article 6).  Notes: (1) If the foul is by the defensive team, the ball reverts to the offensive team prior to enforcement of the foul. (2) If the foul is by the offensive team, the defense must decline the penalty to retain possession. However, if the foul by the offense was a Personal Foul or Unsportsmanlike Conduct Foul, the defense retains possession, and enforcement is from the dead-ball spot. If the defense subsequently loses possession, the penalty is enforced from the spot where possession changed, and the defense retains possession.  (3) If there are Multiple Fouls by the defense, the enforcement shall be that which is most beneficial to the offense.   ARTICLE 4.  FOUL COMMITTED AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION (END ZONE ENFORCEMENT). If there is a foul by either team after a change of possession, and the dead-ball spot is in Team B\u2019s end zone, enforcement shall be as follows:  (a) Fouls by Team A: (1) If the impetus that sent the ball in touch was provided by Team B, enforcement is from the goal line. See Note below for exception when a player\u2019s momentum carries him into the end zone. (2) If the impetus that sent the ball in touch was provided by Team A, enforcement is from the 20-yard line, or from the 25-yard line if the impetus was from a free kick.  (b) Fouls by Team B (Team A impetus): (1) If Team B attempts to advance the ball, and the spot of its foul is in the end zone, the result is a safety. (2) If Team B does not attempt to advance the ball, and its foul occurs in the end zone, enforcement is from the 20-yard line, or from the 25-yard line if the impetus was from a free kick. (3) If the spot of its foul is in the field of play, the penalty is enforced from either the spot of the foul or the touchback spot (20 or 25), whichever is least beneficial to Team B, regardless of whether Team B attempts to advance the ball.   Note: If a Team B player\u2019s original momentum carries him into his end zone, where the ball is declared dead in his team\u2019s possession, the dead-ball spot is considered to be the spot at which the player established possession.

(5) If there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense prior to the offense losing possession during a pass play or a subsequent running play, enforcement is from the dead-ball spot. However, if the defense subsequently loses possession, the penalty is enforced from the spot of the defense's catch or recovery, and the defense retains possession. This also applies to a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense prior to a forward pass thrown from behind the line when the offense fails to make the line to gain.  Notes: (1)  The penalty for a forward pass from behind the line after the ball has been beyond the line, or for a second forward pass from behind the line, is enforced from the previous spot, unless the spot of the pass is behind the passer\u2019s goal line, in which case it is a safety. (2)  If a forward pass is thrown from beyond the line of scrimmage, or when there is no line of scrimmage, it is a foul during a running play.  ARTICLE 6.  FOUL DURING A BACKWARD PASS OR FUMBLE. If there is a foul by either team during a backward pass or fumble, the Basic Spot is the spot of the backward pass or fumble. The three-and-one method of enforcement is used (see Section 3, Article 6).  Notes: (1)  If Team B gains possession in its end zone, and the impetus was provided by Team A, if Team B fumbles or throws a backward pass in the end zone and fouls while the ball is loose, the spot of the fumble or the backward pass is considered to be the B20-yard line, or the 25-yard line if the impetus was from a free kick. (2) If a Team B player\u2019s original momentum carries him into his end zone, where he fumbles the ball, the spot of the fumble is considered to be the spot at which the player established possession. See 11-5-1-Exc. 2. (3) If there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense during a fumble or backward pass that is recovered by the defense, enforcement is from the dead-ball spot. If the recovering team subsequently loses possession, the penalty is enforced from the spot of its recovery, and it retains possession. This also applies to a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense during a fumble or backward pass that is recovered by the offense, and the offense fails to make the line to gain.  ARTICLE 7.  FOUL DURING FREE KICK PLAY. If there is a foul during a free kick, enforcement is from the previous spot, and the free kick is made again. However, if the kicking team commits a foul prior to the end of the kick, and the receiving team retains possession throughout the down, it will have the option of enforcing the penalty at the previous spot and replaying the down or adding the penalty yardage to the dead-ball spot.  Exceptions: (1)  A personal foul (blocking) after a fair-catch signal is enforced from the spot of the foul. (2)  A foul for fair-catch interference is enforced from the spot of the foul. (3)  A foul for interference with the opportunity to make a catch is enforced from the spot of the foul. (4) A foul for an invalid fair catch signal is enforced from the spot of the foul. (5)  A foul for intentionally forming an illegal wedge during the free kick, is enforced from the spot of the foul, or the previous spot if the foul occurs in the end zone during the kick.

A free kick ends when Team B establishes possession. Fouls by Team A prior to the time that Team B establishes possession are offensive fouls. If Team A legally recovers a free kick, there is no change of possession. After Team B establishes possession, a running play begins, and fouls that occur thereafter are enforced from the dead-ball spot or the spot of the foul (three-and-one method).  ARTICLE 8.  FOUL DURING SCRIMMAGE KICK PLAY. If there is a foul from the time of the snap until a legal scrimmage kick ends, enforcement is from the previous spot. This includes a foul during a run prior to a legal kick, and a foul by the kicking team during a missed field-goal attempt.  Exceptions: (1) If the offensive team commits a foul in its own end zone, it is a safety. (2) Unless the kick is a missed field-goal attempt, if there is a foul by the kicking team, the receiving team will have the option of taking the penalty at the previous spot and replaying the down, or adding the penalty yardage on to the dead-ball spot.  Notes: (a) The dead-ball spot for scrimmage kicks that result in a touchback is the 20-yard line. (b) If there is a foul for an illegal touch inside the five-yard line, the receiving team also has the option of accepting a touchback.

(4) Except for fouls that are committed in an attempt to block the kick (such as running into or roughing the kicker, defensive holding (pull-and-shoot), leverage, leaping, and pushing teammate(s) into the offensive formation), if the receiving team commits a foul after the kick crosses the line of scrimmage, the penalty for its infraction will be enforced as if it had been in possession of the ball at the time the foul occurred (a post-possession foul), provided that the receiving team does not lose possession of the ball at any time during the down. The penalty shall be enforced from whichever of the following spots is least beneficial to the receiving team:  (a) the end of the kick; or (b) the spot of the foul.  If the foul occurs in the end zone, it is deemed to have occurred at the 20-yard line, unless enforcement results in a safety (14-4-4).   (5) For enforcement of a personal or unsportsmanlike conduct foul on a play that results in a score, see 14-2-3; for illegally kicking a loose ball, see 12-5-2; and for an illegal bat, see 12-5-1.  When Team B establishes possession of the ball, a scrimmage kick ends, and a running play begins, and fouls that occur thereafter are enforced from the dead-ball spot or the spot of the foul (three-and-one method, 14-3-6).  ARTICLE 9.  DEAD BALL FOUL AND FOUL BETWEEN DOWNS. A Dead Ball Foul is a foul that occurs in the continuing action after a down ends, or a taunting foul that occurs at any time. The penalty for a Dead Ball Foul is enforced from the succeeding spot, and the down counts.  A Foul Between Downs is a foul that occurs after the end of the down and after any continuing action resulting from the down, but prior to the next snap or free kick. The penalty for a Foul Between Downs is enforced from the succeeding spot, and the down counts, but it cannot be combined with a Live Ball Foul or a Dead Ball Foul to create a Multiple or Double Foul. A Foul Between Downs is always enforced separately from any other foul. A foul against an official, regardless of when it occurs, is always treated as a Foul Between Downs. See 12-3-1-e-pen.    Exception: If there is a personal, unsportsmanlike conduct, or taunting foul by either team following the end of the second or fourth periods, the penalty yardage will be enforced on the second-half kickoff or the kickoff in overtime, unless it is part of a Double Foul (See Section 5).  Item 1. Dead Ball Foul by Team A. If there is a Dead Ball Foul by Team A after a down in which Team A has made a first down, after enforcement of the penalty it will be first-and-10 for Team A. If there is a Foul Between Downs after a down in which Team A has made a first down, after enforcement of the penalty it will be first-and-25 for Team A.  Item 2. Dead Ball Fouls by Both Teams. Dead Ball Fouls by both teams are offset at the succeeding spot, and the down counts, but any disqualified player or players must be removed pursuant to Rule 5, Section 2, Article 7.   Item 3. Live Ball and Dead Ball Fouls. Live Ball Fouls and Dead Ball Fouls combine to create Double Fouls or Multiple Fouls, and all customary rules for enforcement apply.

Exceptions: (1) If there is a 5-yard vs. 15-yard Double Foul on the last play of a half, and the 15-yard penalty is for a dead ball foul (personal, unsportsmanlike conduct, or taunting) by either team, the penalty yardage will be enforced on the second half kickoff or the kickoff to start overtime.

COACH CHALLENGES. Each team is permitted two challenges that will initiate Instant Replay reviews: (a) The Head Coach can initiate a challenge by throwing a red flag onto the field of play before the next legal snap or kick. (b) A team that commits a foul that prevents the next snap can no longer challenge the previous play. The non-fouling team can still challenge the previous play, and both teams can benefit from the review. (c) The Head Coach may challenge on-field rulings listed in Section 3, except for those plays that only the Replay Official can challenge (Article 2). (d) Each challenge requires an available team timeout. A team that is out of timeouts, or has used all its available challenges, may not attempt to initiate a challenge.  A team that initiates a challenge when the team is not permitted to challenge will be charged a team timeout.  Penalty: For initiating a challenge when a team has exhausted its timeouts: Loss of 15 yards enforced as a foul between downs.  (e) If a challenge is unsuccessful, the team will be charged a timeout. (f) A team will be permitted a third challenge if it is successful on both of its challenges. A fourth challenge will not be permitted.  ARTICLE 2. REPLAY OFFICIAL REQUEST FOR REVIEW. Only the Replay Official or the Senior Vice President of Officiating or his or her designee may initiate a review of a play: (a) that begins after the two-minute warning of each half; (b) throughout any overtime period; (c) when points are scored by either team;  (d) that is a Try attempt (successful or unsuccessful); and (e) when on-field officials rule:  (1) an interception by an opponent;  (2) a fumble or backward pass recovered by an opponent or that goes out of bounds through the opponent\u2019s end zone;   (3) possession by the kicking team at the end of any free kick or scrimmage kick down; or  (4) a disqualification of a player.  Such plays may be reviewed regardless of whether a foul is committed on the play that, if accepted, would negate the on-field ruling.  The Replay Official may only challenge a play until the next legal snap or kick. The Replay Official may consult with a designated member of the Officiating department at the league office regarding whether to challenge a play.  SECTION 2 REPLAY REVIEWS All Replay Reviews will be conducted by the Senior Vice President of Officiating or his or her designee. Reviews are conducted in consultation with the Replay Official and the Referee, who will have access to a field-level video monitor.  ARTICLE 1. CHANGING A RULING. An on-field ruling will be changed only when the Senior Vice President of Officiating or his or her designee determines that clear and obvious video evidence warrants a change.  ARTICLE 2. LENGTH OF REVIEW. A decision must be made within 60 seconds from when video is shared with the Referee on the field.  ARTICLE 3. SCOPE OF REVIEW. Once a review is initiated, all reviewable aspects of a play (Section 3) may be examined and are subject to change, even if not the specific reason for the challenge.  ARTICLE 4. AWARDING POSSESSION. When the on-field ruling results in a dead ball (e.g., score, down by contact, incomplete pass, etc.), and following replay review it is determined that possession was lost before the ball should have been ruled dead, possession may be awarded to a player who clearly recovers a loose ball in the immediate continuing action. A loose ball that touches out of bounds is deemed a clear recovery by the player who last possessed the ball.  Note: If on-field officials make a preliminary ruling of which team recovered the ball, that preliminary ruling may constitute a clear recovery.  ARTICLE 5. EACH RULING REVIEWED SEPARATELY. Any aspect of a ruling that is not changed will be considered a correct ruling for purposes of reviewing the play.  SECTION 3 REVIEWABLE RULINGS ARTICLE 1. PLAY SITUATIONS. The Replay System will cover the following play situations: (a) Plays involving possession (see Section 3, Article 2). (b) Plays involving touching of either the ball or the ground (see Section 3, Article 3).

(3) This item applies to a ruling that a passer muffed a snap or spiked the ball to stop a running clock.  Item 4. Fumble. Whether a runner lost possession before he was down by contact, or had given himself up.  Notes:  (1) When an on-field ruling is down by contact, and the runner clearly fumbled the ball, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. If there is no clear recovery, the ruling on the field stands. (2) The spot of a forward fumble out of bounds, or a fumble that occurs on fourth down, or after the two-minute warning, or during a Try, is reviewable regardless of whether on-field officials return the ball to the spot of the fumble, and regardless of whether it involves a score, potential score, a change of possession, or the line to gain.  ARTICLE 3. PLAYS INVOLVING TOUCHING OF EITHER THE BALL OR THE GROUND.  Item 1. Down by Contact. Whether a player was down by contact while in possession of the ball.  Item 2. Touching of a Forward Pass. Whether a player touched a forward pass.  Notes: (1) Only the fact of touching, and not intent, is reviewable. (2) A player touching a pass will remove a foul for offensive or defensive pass interference if the touching occurs away from and noticeably before the interference.  Item 3. Touching of a Kick. Whether a player touched a kick and the spot of touching.  Note: A foul for running into or roughing the kicker or holder can be removed if the kicked ball was touched before the contact. If a pre-review announcement was made that there was no foul because the ball was ruled to be touched, a foul for running into or roughing the kicker or holder can be created in replay if the ball was not touched before the contact.  Item 4. Touching of a Loose Ball. Whether a player touched a loose ball.  Item 5. Ball Touching the Ground on a Free Kick. Whether a ball hit the ground after being kicked.  Item 6. Ball Touching the Ground on a Scrimmage Kick. Whether a ball touched the ground before being caught or recovered by a punter or holder.  ARTICLE 4.

A ruling that a runner was out of bounds is reviewable only to determine: (a) the spot of the ball in relation to the line to gain or the goal line at the spot where the runner was ruled to have touched out of bounds; (b) if the runner fumbled the ball before taking two additional steps beyond the spot where he was ruled out of bounds; or (c) if the ball broke the plane of the goal line in the runner\u2019s possession before taking two additional steps beyond the spot where he was ruled out of bounds.  Item 2. Receiver Out of Bounds. Whether a receiver touched out of bounds is reviewable to determine whether he was eligible to touch the ball and whether a defender could legally contact him.  Item 3. Passer Out of Bounds Before Throwing Pass. A ruling that a player stepped out of bounds before throwing a pass is not reviewable to determine if he was inbounds when he threw the pass.  Item 4. Player Out of Bounds on Scrimmage Kick. Whether a player was out of bounds during a scrimmage kick is reviewable to determine the spot of the ball and whether the ball was illegally touched.  Item 5. Loose Ball. Whether a loose ball touched a boundary line, anything on the boundary line, a pylon, or an object.  Note: Ball That Does Not Touch a Boundary Line. If an on-field ruling that a loose ball touched a boundary line is changed, possession can be awarded to a team that recovers the loose ball in the immediate continuing action.  ARTICLE 6. PLAYS GOVERNED BY THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.  Item 1. Illegal Passes. Whether a forward pass was thrown when the passer was beyond the line of scrimmage, or after the ball had crossed the line of scrimmage and returned behind it. Rule 8-1-2, Item 1.  Item 2. Illegal Kick. Whether a scrimmage kick was from beyond the line of scrimmage, or a second kick was made after the ball had crossed the line of scrimmage. Rule 9-1-1.  ARTICLE 7. PLAYS GOVERNED BY THE LINE TO GAIN. The dead-ball spot is reviewable to determine whether it was short of, at, or beyond the line to gain.  Notes: (1) For purposes of a replay review, forward progress is determined when a player with control of the ball is contacted by an opponent and driven backwards. (2) A challenge is successful only if the ruling of whether a new series was awarded is changed, regardless of whether the ball was moved closer to the line to gain. (3) Following review, the ball will be placed at the correct dead-ball spot, but the challenge will be successful only if the line to gain ruling is changed.  ARTICLE 8. NUMBER OF PLAYERS ON THE FIELD. Whether a player is on the field at the snap or when officials rule a dead-ball foul for too many players in formation. For a player to be off the field, he must touch the ground out of bounds. For a player to be on the field, both feet or a body part must touch the ground in the field of play.  ARTICLE 9. GAME ADMINISTRATION AND CONSULTATION. The Replay Official and designated members of the Officiating department may consult with on-field officials, or conduct a replay review, or advise the game officials on specific, objective aspects of a play when clear and obvious video evidence is present, and/or to address game administration issues, including, but not limited to: (a) penalty enforcement; (b) the proper down; (c) spot of a foul; (d) the game clock; (e) possession; (f) completed or intercepted pass; (g) touching of a loose ball, boundary line, goal line, or end line; (h) location of the football or a player in relation to a boundary line, the line of scrimmage, the line to gain, or the goal line; or (i) down by contact (when a player is not ruled down by contact on the field).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3962, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82cbaa4e-4736-4726-8fb4-9511d825fce3": {"__data__": {"id_": "82cbaa4e-4736-4726-8fb4-9511d825fce3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "22351c1c-b9de-4108-94ac-8df55af87b91", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "fe8b8da962cf745ddeebbf8a97a00dc3b5b8ca50d40afe57ffe17a2bc60d81d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b495a33d-da00-41fc-bbe3-2eaeed1e5a78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "cfc9a6d8de19343a795dfe3d9a760694eead5e1f703d43f66ee07866e1b1fafb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c96e1aee-4932-41d9-8de8-741eceb8f790", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "46ba8ee8444a52f0ce1c60ccfb925c2e3ffc47a55d457bb579943b09bc80d3fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ARTICLE 9.

The game clock is reviewable for purposes of restoring time to the clock but not for purposes of taking time off the clock.  Notes: (1) Time can be restored to the game clock if the clock operator incorrectly starts the game clock when it should remain stopped, provided that the correction occurs before the next legal snap or kick.

The Senior Vice President of Officiating or his or her designee may review a decision by on-field officials to disqualify a player. When reviewing a disqualification under this Article other reviewable aspects of the play will not be reviewed unless the Replay Official would otherwise have authority to challenge the play, or it is challenged by a Head Coach.   ARTICLE 11. OTHER REVIEWABLE PLAYS.  Item 1. Direction of a Pass. Whether a pass was forward or backward.  Note: When an on-field ruling is incomplete, and the pass was clearly backward, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. If there is no clear recovery, the ball will be awarded to the team last in possession at the spot where possession was lost.  Item 2. Illegal Forward Pass. Whether a pass was illegally thrown.  Item 3. Field Goal or Try Attempt. Whether a field goal or Try attempt crossed above the crossbar and inside the uprights is reviewable, but only if the ball crosses the plane of the goal post below the top of the uprights, or if the ball touches anything.  Item 4. Illegal Forward Handoff. Whether a player received a handoff clearly in advance of a player making the handoff.  Item 5. Ball Touching a Foreign Object. Whether a loose ball touched a scoreboard, guide wire, or any other object.  Notes: (1) The Replay Official can initiate a challenge for this item at any time during the game.  (2) If it is determined that the ball hit an object, the down will be replayed from the previous spot, and the game clock will be reset to the time when the ball was snapped and will start on the snap.  SECTION 4  NON-REVIEWABLE PLAYS The following aspects of plays are not reviewable: (a) Whether an erroneous whistle sounded; (b) Whether a ball was illegally batted or kicked; (c) Whether a passer intentionally grounded a pass; (d) Whether an ineligible receiver was downfield before a pass; (e) Whether a receiver was illegally contacted; (f) The spot of a loose ball crossing the sideline; (g) Whether a block was illegal; and (h) Any aspect of a play not listed as reviewable in Section 3 of this Rule.  SECTION 5 GAME CLOCK ADMINISTRATION ARTICLE 1. RESETTING GAME CLOCK. When a ruling is changed in replay, the clock status following review is determined by Rule 4-3, and the game clock will be reset to the time when the ball should have been declared dead. The game clock is not reset if the on-field ruling is not changed in replay.   ARTICLE 2. 10-SECOND RUNOFF. When a changed ruling results in a running clock for plays that begin after the two-minute warning, the clock is reset to the time when the play should have ended, and the clock will run for 10 seconds from the reset time. If less than 10 seconds remain in the half or the game, the half or the game is over.  Note: Neither team may decline a 10-second runoff under this Article, but either team can avoid the 10-second runoff by taking a charged team timeout. If the 10-second runoff is avoided, the game clock will be reset to the time when the play should have ended and will start on the snap.  SECTION 6 TIMEOUTS FOLLOWING CHALLENGE ARTICLE 1. UNSUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE. A team that makes an unsuccessful challenge is charged a team timeout.

GENERAL RULES APPLICABLE TO OVERTIME. The following applies in both the regular season and postseason.  (a) If the first team to possess the ball scores a field goal or touchdown, after which the second team loses possession by an interception or fumble, the down will be permitted to run to its conclusion, and all rules of the game will be enforced as customary, including awarding points scored by either team during the down. Only fouls that require the down to be replayed, fouls that negate a score, or palpably unfair acts will be enforced.  Notes: (1) In such situations, if the player who intercepts the pass or recovers the fumble goes to the ground and makes no effort to advance, the covering official will blow his whistle to end the game. (2) If the second team loses possession by an interception or fumble, but the opponent committed a foul prior to the change of possession, the second team\u2019s possession has not legally ended, and the game cannot end on the down. However, in certain situations, the second team cannot decline the penalty and accept the result of the play, or accept a penalty enforcement, if it would create a second possession for itself. In that situation, it can only accept an enforcement that extends its initial possession. (3) The situation in (2) may also affect the team that receives the opening kickoff during its first possession. If there is a foul by the second team followed by a double change of possession, and the first team accepts the result of the play, the second team has had its required possession, and the first team has possession of the ball for the second time. However, if it accepts the penalty, it will extend its initial possession.  69", "start_char_idx": 3440, "end_char_idx": 6130, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96e2d326-df06-4e17-939a-f2cff5e57d71": {"__data__": {"id_": "96e2d326-df06-4e17-939a-f2cff5e57d71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "71c6ca2d-d065-4fe5-867c-9f9ca1c22bbf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "291a8ac35078595f35091803d651be97d854c7fcc68aa1194571388739219db2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0da6086b-ed17-41be-867c-517c9c68ef33", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "ad8e410e4017f0099f52a0a73111593c23acb9d8fdea72cd2ceb047079da3076", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "50814c8d-48f2-4086-a4a1-8dd714137aff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b7655ad5bb5066daa879dc35431b00e562061650bc21288536c1853c860f209", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rule 16 (b) A player is in possession when he has a firm grip and control of the ball inbounds (3-2-7).

NON-PLAYER ON FIELD. If any non-player, including photographers, reporters, employees, police or spectators, enters the field of play or end zones, and in the judgment of an official said party or parties interfere with the play, the Referee, after consulting the crew (13-1-7 and 19-1-3), shall enforce any such penalty or score as the interference warrants.  ARTICLE 2.  FIELD CONTROL. If spectators enter the field and/or interfere with the progress of the game in such a manner that in the opinion of the Referee the game cannot continue, the Referee shall declare timeout. In such a case, the Referee shall record the number of the down, distance to be gained, and the position of the ball on the field. The Referee shall also secure from the Line Judge the playing time remaining and record it. The Referee shall then order the home club through its management to have the field cleared, and when it is cleared and order restored and the safety of the spectators, players and officials is assured to the satisfaction of the Referee, the game must continue even if it is necessary to use lights.  ARTICLE 3.  GAME CALLED. If the game must be called due to a state or municipal law, or by darkness if no lights are available, an immediate report shall be made to the Commissioner by the home club, visiting club, and officials. On receipt of all reports, the Commissioner shall make a decision which will be final.  ARTICLE 4.  EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. The NFL affirms the position that in most circumstances all regular-season and postseason games should be played to their conclusion. If, in the opinion of appropriate League authorities, it is impossible to begin or continue a game due to an emergency, or a game is deemed to be imminently threatened by any such emergency (e.g., severely inclement weather, lightning, flooding, power failure), the following procedures (Articles 5 through 11) will serve as guidelines for the Commissioner and/or the duly appointed representatives. The Commissioner has the authority to review the circumstances of each emergency and to adjust the following procedures in whatever manner the Commissioner deems appropriate. If, in the Commissioner\u2019s opinion, it is reasonable to project that the resumption of an interrupted game would not change its ultimate result or adversely affect any other inter-team competitive issue, the Commissioner is empowered to terminate the game.  ARTICLE 5.  LEAGUE AUTHORITY. The League employees vested with the authority to define emergencies under these procedures are the Commissioner, designated representatives from the League office staff, and the game Referee. In those instances where neither the Commissioner nor the designated representative is in attendance at a game, the Referee will have sole authority; provided, however, that if the Referee delays the beginning of or interrupts a game for a significant period of time due to an emergency, the Referee must make every effort to contact the Commissioner or the Commissioner\u2019s designated representative for consultation. In all cases of significant delay, the League authorities will consult with the management of the participating clubs and will attempt to obtain appropriate information from outside sources, if applicable (e.g., weather bureau, police).  ARTICLE 6.  LATER DATE. If, because of an emergency, a regular-season or postseason game is not started at its scheduled time and cannot be played at any later time that same day, the game nevertheless must be played on a subsequent date to be determined by the Commissioner.  ARTICLE 7.  PRE-GAME THREAT. If there is deemed to be a threat of an emergency that may occur during the playing of a game (e.g., an incoming tropical storm), the starting time of such game will not be moved to an earlier time unless there is clearly sufficient time to make an orderly change.  ARTICLE 8.  INTERRUPTED GAME. If, under emergency circumstances, an interrupted regular-season or post-season game cannot be completed on the same day, such game will be rescheduled by the Commissioner and resumed at that point.  ARTICLE 9.  ALTERNATE DATES, SITES. In instances under these emergency procedures which require the Commissioner to reschedule a regular-season game, the Commissioner will make every effort to set the game for no later than two days after its originally scheduled date, and will attempt to schedule the game at its original site.

ARTICLE 10.  POSTSEASON INTERRUPTION. If an emergency interrupts a postseason game and such game cannot be resumed on that same date, the Commissioner will make every effort to arrange for its completion as soon as possible. If unable to schedule the game at the same site, the Commissioner will select an appropriate alternate site. The Commissioner will terminate the game short of completion only, if in the Commissioner\u2019s judgment, the continuation of the game would not be normally expected to alter the ultimate result.  ARTICLE 11.  GAME RESUMPTION. In all instances where a game is resumed after interruption, either on the same date or a subsequent date, the resumption will begin at the point at which the game was interrupted. At the time of interruption, the Referee will call timeout and will make a record of the following: the team possessing the ball, direction in which its offense was headed, position of the ball on the field, down, distance, period, time remaining in the period, and any other pertinent information required for an efficient and equitable resumption of play.  SECTION 2 EXTRAORDINARILY UNFAIR ACTS ARTICLE 1.  COMMISSIONER AUTHORITY. The Commissioner has the sole authority to investigate and take appropriate disciplinary and/or corrective measures if any club action, non-participant interference, or calamity occurs in an NFL game which the Commissioner deems so extraordinarily unfair or outside the accepted tactics encountered in professional football that such action has a major effect on the result of the game.

SECTION 2 SUPPORT FROM NFL OFFICIATING STAFF The Replay Official and designated members of the Officiating department at the League office may consult with the on-field officials to provide objective information regarding on-field rulings and the correct application of playing rules. In addition, if the designated members of the Officiating department determine that a foul for a football or non-football act called on the field is flagrant, then they can instruct the on-field officiating crew to disqualify the player(s) who committed the foul. Those players who were not penalized, but who engaged in football or non-football acts that were determined to be flagrant and directly related to the foul called on the field, may also be disqualified by designated members of the Officiating department. A penalty will be assessed when a player was not penalized by on-field officials but was subsequently disqualified pursuant to this Section. The determination that a foul is flagrant must be based on the available video provided on the television broadcast, and the designated members of the Officiating department must instruct the officiating crew to disqualify the identified player(s) before the ball is next legally put in play.  \n74", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2384, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

Second-and-6 on A40. A1 runs to the A47 and pretends to fumble but throws the ball forward out of bounds. Seven minutes remain in the game.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, third-and-4 on A42. Illegal forward pass. The clock starts on the snap. (3-22-4, 8-1-1)  A.R. 3.2 INTENTIONAL FUMBLE FORWARD\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Fourth-and-10 on B35. With 1:22 left in the game, and Team B ahead 21-20, A1 scrambles to the B21 and intentionally fumbles the ball forward to the B20 where it is recovered by B1 who returns it to the B22. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B26. This is an illegal forward pass thrown from beyond the line and is dead (incomplete) when it hits the ground. (3-2-5). The five-yard penalty is enforced from the spot of the pass, which takes the ball back to a spot that is short of the line to gain. The loss of down results in the ball going over to Team B on downs. (3-22-4, 8-1-1). There is no 10-second runoff because the result after enforcement is a change of possession.  A.R. 3.3 FUMBLE\u2014OUT OF BOUNDS Third-and-4 on A35. A1 runs to the A41, is tackled near the sideline, and fumbles the ball. B1, on his feet, gains control of the ball at the sideline at the A39 with one foot inbounds, and then his second foot hits out of bounds. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A39. B1 did not possess the ball with two feet inbounds. The ball is placed at the out of bounds spot, since it was behind the spot of the fumble, and the game clock starts on the Referee\u2019s signal that a ball has been returned to the field of play. (3-2-5, 4-3-2).  A.R. 3.4 DOT THE I\u2014COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE CATCH Second-and-10 on A35. A1 throws a forward pass to A2 at the A47 sideline. While A2 is stretched out over the sideline, he controls the ball and \u201changs\u201d over the sideline with both feet contacting the ground inbounds: (a) the first thing to hit the ground out of bounds is the point of the ball, but the ball does not move in his hands; or (b) as he lands on his shoulder out of bounds, he loses possession of the ball. Rulings: (a) First-and-10 on A47. Completed catch. (3-2-7-Note 2) (b) Third-and-10 on A35. Incomplete pass. (3-2-7-Note 2)  A.R. 3.5 LOOSE BALL BETWEEN LEGS OF PLAYER\u2014NO POSSESSION Second-and-10 on B40. A1 runs with the ball to the B30 where he fumbles. In the scramble for the loose ball, B1 ends up on the ground with the ball securely held between his legs, although his hands/arms are not around the ball. A2, while standing on his feet, reaches down and pulls the ball from B2 and runs for a touchdown. Ruling: Touchdown. Kickoff A35. Possession requires control with the hands or arms. (3-2-7-Item 1)  A.R. 3.6 PASS CONTROLLED AT SIDELINE\u2014PLAYER KNOCKED OUT OF BOUNDS BEFORE TWO FEET DOWN First-and-10 on A30. A1 throws a pass for A2 near the sideline at the 50. B1 leaps near the sideline to intercept, controls the ball, and comes down with one foot inbounds. His second foot would have come down inbounds, but A2 shoves him out of bounds. Ruling: Second-and-10 on A30. Incomplete pass.

B1 leaps near the sideline to intercept, controls the ball, and comes down with one foot inbounds. His second foot would have come down inbounds, but A2 shoves him out of bounds. Ruling: Second-and-10 on A30. Incomplete pass. (3-2-7, 8-1-3)  A.R. 3.7 DROP KICK From a legal free kick formation, kicker A1 drops the ball at the A35-yard line, where he kicks it into the air immediately after it bounces off the ground. B1 signals for a fair catch and catches the ball at the 50. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. Legal fair catch. B1\u2019s fair catch signal is valid because the ball did not touch the ground after it was kicked. If the kicker attempts a drop kick, but does not kick the ball as, or immediately after, it touches the ground, the kick is illegal, and officials should blow the play dead.  A.R. 3.8 PENALTY FOR DISQUALIFIED PLAYER FAILING TO LEAVE BENCH AREA In the third quarter, A2 is disqualified from the game for slugging an opponent. The Referee properly advises the head coach that the player must be removed from the bench area. Near the end of the third quarter, the Referee notices the player in street clothes in the bench area after having been told to leave. Ruling: Fifteen-yard penalty for Unsportsmanlike Conduct, and the disqualified player is removed from the playing area. (3-8)  A.R. 3.9 FAIR-CATCH SIGNAL\u2014BEHIND THE LINE Fourth-and-7 on A40. A1\u2019s punt is blocked and it goes straight up in the air behind the line of scrimmage. B1 signals for a fair catch (valid or invalid) on the A36 and is tackled immediately by A3. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A36. No foul by A3 or B1 since a fair catch cannot occur behind the line of scrimmage. (3-10)  A.R. 3.10 DEAD-BALL FOUL\u2014AFTER FIRST DOWN MADE Second-and-6 on A38. A1 runs to the 50 and is tackled. Immediately after the play, A3 clips B4 at the A48. Ruling: First-and-10 on A35. A dead-ball foul is enforced from the succeeding spot. However, A made the line to gain, thus it is a first down and ten yards to go after a 15-yard penalty.

Note: The impetus that puts the ball into the end zone is A2\u2019s block of passive B3, (who is not attempting to block or recover the ball). If the official feels the block by A2 was unnecessary, A2 could be flagged for hitting a player out of the play and penalized for unnecessary roughness.  A.R. 3.13 BLOCKED PUNT INTO END ZONE\u2014IMPETUS  Fourth-and-10 on A7. A\u2019s punt is partially blocked by B1. B2 muffs the ball at the A10, and the ball rebounds into A\u2019s end zone where: (a) A2 falls on it; (b) A3 and B3 simultaneously recover it; or (c) the ball rolls over the end line.  Rulings: (a) Safety. (3-29, 3-17) (b) Touchdown. (11-2-1, 3-17) (c) Safety. (3-17, 11-5-1)  Note: If A had recovered in the field of play, it would have been A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 since Team B touched the ball beyond the line of scrimmage.   A.R. 3.14 BAT BY TEAM B ON PUNT INTO TEAM B END ZONE Fourth-and-10 on 50. A1's punt is rolling on the B10 when B1 bats the ball backward out of the back of the end zone. At the time of the bat, the rolling punt was: (a) nearly at rest; or (b) still rolling toward the sideline (not nearly at rest). Rulings: (a) and (b) Safety B, Safety Kick B20.   Note: The bat is legal in both (a) and (b), but any bat of a loose ball creates a new impetus.  A.R. 3.15 RUNNER DIVES - HITS PYLON - BALL IN TEAM B END ZONE Third-and-goal on B3. A1 dives at the B1, and his shoulder hits the pylon with the ball in his right arm at the B\u00bd-yard line. He continues into the end zone where his chest is the first thing to touch the ground, hitting in the end zone just after the ball crosses the goal line extended.  Ruling: Touchdown. Kickoff A35. (3-21-1)  A.R. 3.16 PYLON\u2014GOAL LINE EXTENDED Second-and-goal on B5. A2, running to his right, is contacted by B2, and as he is going down at the B1, he dives toward the pylon. The ball is held in his right hand extended over the out of bounds area but beyond the extended goal line, when his chest hits: (a) the ground, just short of the goal line (A2\u2019s chest is the first thing to hit the ground); (b) the pylon, after which he lands out of bounds beyond the goal line extended; or (c) the ground in the end zone. The ball crossed the sideline at the B\u00bd-yard line, but it never went over the top of the pylon.  Rulings: (a) Third-and-goal on B\u00bd. Since the runner was down short of the goal line, the ball must break the goal-line plane, hit the pylon, or go over the top of the pylon for a touchdown.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3229, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f86642c2-0d06-4cae-8bbc-076172577f63": {"__data__": {"id_": "f86642c2-0d06-4cae-8bbc-076172577f63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7c7ca2a6-0ee6-40b1-833e-0de2be6c01a9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "d61483bb6f268f42fe9cb083581f8cc57e52974114452d4b58868eaa82d9833d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e63b71f-d465-46ce-abcc-0ca4255601e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "a8fab830809b5017b850de1e7ff395bea73aeb065a1d73712811e41c2a6de068", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b1989fa-0603-4b6d-a79d-ab7d7e7e1508", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e9e1563566fbb952c75c7bc53a216acbe4f8ebe7a8f20d8af5106cbdd2f2e2e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A2, running to his right, is contacted by B2, and as he is going down at the B1, he dives toward the pylon.

Rulings: (a) and (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B40. Illegally kicking or batting a loose ball behind the line of scrimmage is enforced 10 yards from the previous spot, and a loss of down.   Note: Illegally batting or kicking the ball is a 10-yard penalty, and if by Team A, also a loss of down. The one exception is if the foul is by Team A beyond the line of scrimmage, during a scrimmage kick, in which case there is no loss of down.

The game is played in a stadium with a scoreboard gondola hanging from the ceiling, or a Skycam. Back A2 is illegally in motion forward at the snap. The punt is a high kick that hits the scoreboard or Skycam and comes down at the B45 where B1 catches it and returns it to the A15 where he is downed. Ruling: Fourth-and-4 on A30. Void the play. The illegal motion foul is declined by rule. The ball is dead. (7-2-1-a) Return the game clock to what it read when the ball was snapped, and the clock would start on the snap. (Same ruling on any play. If the ball hits the scoreboard or Skycam, the down is replayed and only personal fouls or unsportsmanlike conduct fouls are enforced, from the previous spot.) This may be reviewed by Replay Official at any time or challenged by either coach outside two minutes of either half.  RULE 4 GAME TIMING GENERAL TIMING RULES A.R. 4.1 BETWEEN PERIODS\u2014COACH ON THE FIELD During the intermission between the first and second periods, while the Referee and Umpire are preparing to move the ball to the other end of the field, the Referee suddenly discovers Team A\u2019s head coach in the middle of the field arguing about the last play of the quarter. Ruling: Penalize Team A 15 yards from the succeeding spot for the coach illegally entering the field. This is a foul if it occurs at any point during the game. Since the coach is being penalized for being on the field, as opposed to what he is saying to the official, (or how he is saying it), this is not the type of foul that counts toward a potential disqualification.   A.R. 4.2 COIN TOSS\u2014CAPTAINS At the coin toss: (a) a coach refuses to send any captains to the middle of the field to participate in the coin-toss ceremony; or (b) a coach sends out his entire team to the middle of the field to participate in the ceremony; or (c) a coach sends out his six team captains to the middle of the field to participate in the coin toss. Two of these captains are injured and are not in uniform for this game.  Rulings:  (a) Loss of coin-toss option for both halves and loss of 15 yards from spot of opening kickoff. At least one captain from each team is required to be present for the coin toss. (b) Loss of coin-toss option for both halves and loss of 15 yards from spot of opening kickoff. Captains are limited to six per team. (c) Legal. A team is limited to six captains: active, inactive, or honorary.  A.R. 4.3 COIN TOSS\u2014INVALID TOSS After getting the call from the visiting team captain, the Referee tosses the coin in the air, but it does not turn over before hitting the ground.  Ruling: The coin toss is void and another toss is made. The visiting team captain cannot change his original call. If the coin does not turn over, or in the Referee\u2019s judgment the toss has been compromised in some way, there will be another toss.  A.R. 4.4 FUMBLE\u2014OUT OF BOUNDS Third-and-7 on A45. A2 runs to the 50 and fumbles the ball out of bounds at the A47. Ruling: Fourth-and-5 on A47, and the game clock starts as a new ball is brought back into the field of play. (4-3-2)  A.R. 4.5 FUMBLE\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Second-and-10 on B40 with 1:30 left in the game. A1 fumbles at the B36 and the fumble is recovered by A2 at the B34 where he picks up the ball and runs with it. Ruling: Since a teammate other than the fumbling player recovers the fumble after the two-minute warning, the play is blown dead when A2 recovers.

Thirty seconds remain in the game. A2 takes a handoff behind the line. A2 is tackled at the B4 and fumbles with the ball going into the end zone. A3 recovers the ball in the end zone. Ruling: Third-and-goal on B4. The clock will stop upon the recovery. It should be restarted by the Referee as the ball is being brought back into the field before it is spotted at the hash mark. (The Referee should advise the quarterback that the game clock will start.) The play clock starts when the play is blown dead and continues to run. If this same scenario occurs, but the ball is recovered in Team A\u2019s end zone, the play is blown dead immediately and results in a safety.  A.R. 4.8 BACKWARD PASS OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014BEFORE TWO-MINUTE WARNING Second-and-5 on A35. Quarterback A1 throws a backward pass to A3 who muffs the ball at the A32 and the ball goes out of bounds there. Four minutes remain in the second half. Ruling: Third-and-8 on A32. The game clock is stopped when the ball goes out of bounds, but it is restarted by the Referee, before it is spotted, when the new ball is being brought back into the field. (Advise the quarterback that the clock is being started).  A.R. 4.9 BACKWARD PASS OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Third-and-8 on A30. A1 pitches back to A2 at the A25. A2 muffs the pitch and the ball goes out of bounds at the A35 with 30 seconds left to play in the second quarter. Ruling: Third-and-13 on A25 (Illegal Action to Conserve Time), or Fourth-and-3 on A35 (decline penalty). If the penalty is accepted, run 10 seconds (0:20) and wind the clock. Team B can accept the penalty yardage and decline the runoff. If the runoff is declined, or Team A uses a timeout to avoid the runoff, the clock will start on the snap. If Team B declines the penalty, then there is no runoff and the clock starts on the snap.  A.R. 4.10 RUNNER OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014FIVE MINUTES OR MORE IN FOURTH QUARTER Third-and-6 on A21. Runner A2 goes out of bounds at the A31 with exactly five minutes (or more) remaining in the fourth quarter. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A31. The game clock is started when an official spots the ball at the inbounds spot, and the Referee gives the signal to start the game clock. If the game clock was at 4:59 when the runner went out of bounds, it would start on the next snap.  A.R. 4.11 KICKOFF/SAFETY KICK\u2014STARTING GAME CLOCK A kickoff from the A35, or a safety kick from the A20, occurs at any time of the game.

Team A, with no timeouts left and behind by two points, decides to attempt a field goal on third down. The ball is snapped to the holder, but he is tackled at the B23 before the kick can be made.

As Team A breaks the huddle, Team B Head Coach throws the red flag to challenge the prior play. The Referee stops both clocks with 14 seconds on the play clock. After discussion with the coach, it is determined that the play is not reviewable, so no challenge is granted, and a timeout is not charged. Ruling: Second-and-2 on B30. After advising both teams that there are 14 seconds on the play clock and giving them a reasonable opportunity to get ready, the Referee starts the play clock at 14 seconds and winds both clocks.

With the game clock stopped due to an incomplete pass on the prior play, and the play clock running at 28 seconds, the Down Judge stops the game because the chains are tangled and are not set. Ruling: Third-and-10 on A45. After fixing the chains and advising both teams and giving them a reasonable opportunity to get ready, the Referee starts the play clock at 28 seconds.

If a timeout was taken, the play clock would be set to 25 seconds and started on the ready-for-play signal.  A.R. 4.17 PLAY CLOCK INTERRUPTED INSIDE 10 SECONDS\u2014INJURED PLAYER\u2014REFEREE DISCRETION Second-and-8 on A35 with 2:45 remaining in the 4th quarter. The game clock is running with Team B out of timeouts and Team A leading 21-20. As Quarterback A1 is under center and calling signals, A2 suddenly collapses, apparently injured. The play clock is at :04 and the game clock is at 2:09 when the game is stopped for the injured player. Ruling: Second-and-8 on A35. Both play clock and game clock will remain at the same time as when the game was stopped. A2 must leave the game (or call a timeout). After A2 leaves the game, and after the Referee has advised both teams and given them reasonable opportunity to get ready, the Referee winds both clocks on the ready-for-play signal. This prevents time from being added to the play clock that would allow Team A to run the game clock to the two-minute warning. If no such timing advantage exists, the play clock will be set to 10 seconds.  A.R. 4.18 CLOCK STATUS AFTER BLOCKED FIELD GOAL Third-and-5 on B10. With eight seconds remaining in a tied game, Team A attempts a field goal from the B18. The attempt is blocked, and A1 recovers and is tackled at the B12. Team A has used all of its timeouts. Ruling: Fourth-and-7 on B12. The clock continues to run and will likely expire, as there has been no change of possession.  A.R. 4.19 CLOCK STATUS AFTER PUNT\u2014PENALTY TEAM A Fourth-and-10 on 50. Team A is in an illegal formation. A1\u2019s punt, at 10:00 of the first quarter, rolls dead untouched at the B1. Ruling: Fourth-and-15 on A45, or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B6. The clock will start on the snap because it was stopped for the change of possession.  A.R. 4.20 CLOCK STATUS AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION\u2014FOUL ON PLAY Second-and-10 on A35. With 8:30 remaining in the third quarter, A1 fumbles the ball at the A30, where it is recovered and downed by B1. B1 was offside on the play. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, second-and-5 on A40. The clock starts on the snap, because it was stopped for the change of possession. If there is a change of possession during the down, the game clock will start on the snap, regardless of whether the change of possession is negated by a penalty.  A.R. 4.21 CLOCK STATUS AFTER FOUL THAT PREVENTS THE SNAP\u2014FOURTH QUARTER OR OVERTIME Fourth-and-10 on B45. With 6:00 remaining in the fourth quarter and the clock running, lineman A1 commits a false start. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-15 on 50. False start. The clock starts on the snap, because the offense committed a foul that prevented the snap in the fourth quarter. The clock starts on the snap regardless of whether the foul is accepted or declined. A foul is considered to prevent the snap if it is committed after the ball is made ready for play and causes the clock to stop before a snap.  A.R. 4.22 CLOCK STATUS AFTER DOUBLE FOUL BEFORE THE SNAP\u2014FOURTH QUARTER OR OVERTIME Fourth-and-10 on B45. With 6:00 remaining in the fourth quarter and the clock running, lineman A1 commits a false start and defensive lineman B1 comes across the line and forcibly shoves A1 to the ground.

Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. False start and Unnecessary Roughness. This is a 5-15 enforcement where the FST is disregarded by rule and the UNR foul is enforced against Team B. The clock starts on the ready for play because this is not an offensive foul that prevents the snap since the Team B foul is the only foul enforced by rule.  A.R. 4.23 CLOCK STATUS AFTER DISQUALIFICATION First-and-10 on A20. A1 takes a handoff and runs to the A30, where he is tackled. Officials call a use of helmet foul on tackler B1. After enforcement, and the play clock at 0:17, the Officiating department stops the game and instructs officials to disqualify B1. Ruling: A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on A45. B1 is disqualified. The play clock remains at 0:17 and will start on the Referee\u2019s signal.  A.R. 4.24 FLAG PICKUP\u2014LAST TWO MINUTES Third-and-4 on B25. Runner A1 is downed inbounds after a gain of two yards. Immediately after the play, B1 pushes A2, and the Umpire throws his flag for unnecessary roughness. After discussion with the Referee, the Umpire picks up his flag, as there was not significant enough contact to call a foul on the play. The time remaining in the game is 1:06.

The clock starts upon the legal touching by A7, so at least one second will run off the clock. (f) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A44. 0:03 on the clock. No time runs off the clock, because the ball was not legally touched prior to A\u2019s recovery. Team B can take the ball at the spot of the illegal touch, or re-kick with a 5-yard penalty. The penalty cannot be assessed from the dead ball spot, because Team A has legal possession at the end of the down.  INJURY TIMEOUTS A.R. 4.26 TEAM A PLAYER INJURED\u2014EXCESS TIMEOUT First-and-10 on B36. Forty seconds remain in the first half. Team A leads 17-14 and has used three timeouts previously in the half. Ball carrier A1 runs to the B31 and is downed inbounds. A2 is injured. Ruling: Second-and-5 on B31. Charge Team A with its fourth timeout, and after the injured player has left the field, run 10 seconds and wind the clock. The play clock is reset to 25 seconds. B can decline the runoff, but there is no option to start the clock on the snap unless Team B takes a timeout. A2 must remain out for one play unless Team B calls a timeout.   A.R. 4.27 EXCESS TIMEOUT UNDER TWO MINUTES \u2014 PREVENTS CLOCK FROM STARTING Second-and-3 on B33. A1 runs to the B25, where he is hit and fumbles the ball, which goes out of bounds at the B23 with 50 seconds remaining in the first half. Both teams have used all timeouts. A1 is injured on the play. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B25 (0:40). Charge Team A with its fourth timeout, run 10 seconds and wind the clock when the ball is ready for play. Team B has an option to decline the runoff. A1 must remain out for one play. The excess timeout delays the clock from starting on the ready for play once the ball is returned inbounds, so there is a 10-second runoff (4-5-4, Note 3).  A.R. 4.28 TEAM REQUESTS FOURTH TIMEOUT \u2014 IGNORED Prior to the two-minute warning of either half, Team A gains 15 yards and a first down and is tackled inbounds at the B40. Team A had previously used three timeouts and requests a fourth timeout. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B40. The request for a timeout is ignored. If the timeout is incorrectly granted, it will count as Team A\u2019s fourth timeout, Team A will be penalized five yards for delay of game, and the game clock will be started on the ready for play.  A.R. 4.29 FIFTH TIMEOUT CHARGED \u2014 TEAM B Third-and-4 on B22. Forty seconds remain in the game. A1 throws an incomplete pass. B1 is injured and Team B  had previously used four team timeouts in the half. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B17. Charge Team B with their fifth team timeout which requires a five-yard penalty. Set the play clock to 40 seconds, and the game clock starts on the snap, because of the incomplete pass.

Charge each team with a timeout; the play clock is set to 25 seconds; and the game clock is started with the snap, unless both timeouts were excess, in which case the clock starts on the ready-for-play signal. No excess timeout fouls are enforced and there can be no 10-second runoff. If either team had a timeout left, it is used, thus allowing both players to remain in the game.

B2 is injured downfield but discovered significantly after Team A was charged with the injury timeout. Ruling: Team A and Team B are both charged with injury timeouts.

After two minutes, the Referee declares the ball ready for play after A2 is removed from the game. Team B then calls a timeout. The Referee grants a 30-second timeout. After the timeout, Team A calls a timeout, and A2 re-enters the game. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, third-and-9 on B35.

Defensive pass interference is called at the B10 on the play. While the foul is being reported to the Referee, he notices attendants have come on the field because Tackle A3 was hurt at the line of scrimmage. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-goal on B10. There is not a charged injury timeout, due to the change of possession prior to enforcement of the penalty (failure to make a first down on fourth down). However, A3 must leave for one play unless a timeout is called.  A.R. 4.43 FOUL ON THE PLAY/TOUCHDOWN\u2014INJURY Third-and-10 on 50. With 0:35 remaining in the fourth quarter, Team A has previously been charged with four timeouts. The pass is complete to A2 for a touchdown. Offensive pass interference is called on the play. While the foul is being reported to the Referee, he notices attendants have come on the field because Tackle A3 was hurt at the line of scrimmage. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, third-and-20 on A40.

With 1:23 remaining in a tied game, A1 slides down at the A48 where he jumps up and calls a timeout, which is granted. After the Referee announces the timeout, it is discovered that B1 was injured on the play, and Team B trainers have already come on the field, or thereafter come on the field, to assist B1.  Ruling: Second-and-2 on A48. Team A\u2019s timeout is restored, and Team B is charged with a timeout. If it is an excess timeout, B1 must leave for 1 play, the play clock is set to :40, and the game clock starts on the ready. If Team B has remaining timeouts, they are charged a timeout, (or if Team A still wants a charged timeout), in which case, B1 can remain in the game, the play clock is set to :25, and the game clock starts on the snap.

Wideout A2 is not on the line of scrimmage at the snap, leaving only 6 offensive players on the line. QB A1 throws an incomplete pass, and B2 is injured on the play. Team B has already been charged with their 4th timeout for a prior injury. Ruling: Fourth-and-5 on B15. These fouls do not offset; each are enforced separately. Team B will likely decline the illegal formation foul, making it fourth-and-10. The fifth time out for an injury requires a 5-yard penalty against Team B, which is assessed regardless of clock status. The play clock is set to 40 seconds. The game clock starts on the snap, because of the incomplete pass, as well as the illegal formation penalty. B2 must leave the game for one play, unless a timeout is called.

Team A has been hurrying to get off as many plays as possible during the drive, although they have been briefly huddling between plays. Team A is flagged for 12 men in the offensive huddle. Team A has used its three timeouts. Ruling: Second-and-10 on B20. Run 10 seconds if Team B chooses, if in the Referee\u2019s judgment Team A was attempting to conserve time. There could be situations in which this would not be a 10-second runoff, if the team is not hurrying to get plays off and thereby not conserving time.  A.R. 4.50 NOT ALL OFFENSIVE PLAYERS SET BEFORE SNAP\u2014CLOCK RUNNING AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Second-and-10 on B35. The score is tied, the clock is running, and: (a) 50 seconds; or (b) 1:50 remains in the game.  As Team A hurries to the line, the ball is snapped before tailback A2 gets set.

Run 10 seconds off the game clock, if Team B chooses, and the clock starts on the ready-for-play signal. When all 11 offensive players do not get set simultaneously prior to the snap, and the game clock is running after the two-minute warning of the half, the illegal shift converts to a false start, and the play must be shut down immediately. If all 11 players get set, and then two players shift without resetting prior to the snap, it is a live ball foul for an illegal shift, and there is no runoff.  A.R. 4.51 BACK FAILS TO SET BEFORE SNAP\u2014CLOCK STOPPED Second-and-10 on B35. The score is tied, the clock is stopped due to an incomplete pass on the prior play. There are 50 seconds remaining in the game. As Team A goes up to the line, the ball is snapped before tailback A2 gets set. Team A has already used its three timeouts. A1\u2019s pass falls incomplete. Ruling: Third-and-10 on B35 or second-and-15 on B40. Since the clock was stopped at the snap, the \u201cconserving time rules\u201d are not in effect. It is an illegal shift, rather than a false start, because the clock was not running, so the foul does not prevent the snap. The clock starts on the snap for the next play.   A.R. 4.52 PLAYERS MOVING AT THE SNAP Third-and-10 on B30. With the clock running any time during the game, all members of the offense get fully set for one second, but as the ball is snapped: (a) left guard A2, (b) tight end A3, (c) wingback A5, (d) or tailback A6, is going from a two-point stance to a three-point stance, or is rolling forward, when the ball is snapped; or when the ball is snapped, (e) wide receiver A4, after coming set, is moving from off the line of scrimmage up to the line of scrimmage, or from on the line of scrimmage to off the line of scrimmage, (not an abrupt motion), or (f) wide receiver A4 is clearly off the line of scrimmage and moves forward to a position that is still clearly off the line of scrimmage. A1\u2019s pass falls incomplete. Rulings:  (a), (b), (c), (d), (e): Third-and-15 on B35. False start.

Team A is in a hurry-up offense. The ball is snapped and the runner is downed on the B15. Team A had only six men on the line of scrimmage, but all 11 players were in close proximity to the line of scrimmage. Ruling: Second-and-8 on B47. No 10-second runoff since A\u2019s penalty did not prevent the snap. The clock starts on the snap.  A.R. 4.54 DELAY OF GAME BY TEAM A\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Third-and-10 on B45. Fifty seconds remain in the game and Team A is behind in the score. A1 gets confused on what play to call and Team A is called for delay of game. Ruling: Third-and-15 on 50.

A.R. 4.55 ILLEGAL SHIFT/MOTION\u2014TEAM B OFFSIDE\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Second-and-10 on B35. With 0:50 remaining in a tied game, Team A is in a hurry-up offense and B1 is set and lined up offside. (a) Back A2 never gets set before the ball is snapped; or (b) back A2 gets set but then goes in motion and is moving toward the line of scrimmage at the snap. QB A1 spikes the ball. Rulings: (a) Second-and-15 on B40. Ten-second runoff. The illegal shift converts to a false start, and the play is blown dead immediately after the snap. There is no foul for offside, since there was no legal snap. (b) Second-and-10 on B35. Let the play go through, and the penalties offset.

Since the ball went out of bounds (spot of the foul) in advance of the spot of the backward pass (the basic spot), enforce from the spot of the backward pass (Rule 8-7-7). Ten seconds would also be run off the clock, if the defense so chooses, and wind the clock. If a foul for conserving time or 10-second runoff is declined, the game clock will start on the snap.  A.R. 4.57 BACKWARD PASS OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Third-and-10 on B30. Fifty seconds remain in a tied game, and Team A is out of timeouts, A1 runs the ball to the B14 where he throws a backward pass out of bounds. The ball goes out of bounds at the B21. Ruling: Option for Team B: Fourth-and-1 on B21, clock starts on snap (penalty is declined, therefore no runoff), or third-and-6 on B26 with a 10-second runoff, if B elects, and the clock starts on the ready-for-play signal. The penalty is enforced from the out of bounds spot (the spot of the foul) because it is behind the spot of the backward pass (the basic spot). This is a three-and-one enforcement. Rule 8-7-7.  A.R. 4.58 BACKWARD PASS OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Second-and-20 on 50. With 1:30 remaining in the fourth quarter, A1 scrambles, and while at the A40, throws the ball backward and out of bounds at the A35. Team A has already used its three timeouts.  Ruling: Option for Team B: Third-and-35 on A35. The penalty is declined, so there is no 10-second runoff, (and the clock is on the snap); or second-and-25 on A45 with a 10-second runoff, if B elects, and wind the clock. This is a three-and-one enforcement (Rule 8-7-7). If either the spot of the backward pass (basic spot) or the spot where the ball went out of bounds (spot of the foul) is behind the line of scrimmage, the foul is enforced from the previous spot (Rule 14-3-6).  A.R. 4.59 TEAM B THROWS BALL OUT OF BOUNDS AFTER INTERCEPTION Third-and-10 on B45. Twenty-five seconds remain in a tied game. A1\u2019s pass is intercepted by B2 at the B30. As B2  returns the interception, he sees that time is about to expire, so when he is at the A25, he throws a forward pass out of bounds to stop the clock with 12 seconds left. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A30. This is an illegal forward pass which requires a 5-yard penalty from the spot of the pass. There is no 10-second runoff, as the change of possession results in a stopped clock. This is not an illegal action to conserve time. The clock starts on the snap.  A.R. 4.60 INTENTIONAL GROUNDING\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Third-and-20 on 50. There is 1:35 remaining in a tied game, and Team A is out of timeouts. A1 drops back to pass, and at the A35 intentionally grounds the pass to avoid a sack. Ruling: Fourth-and-35 on A35. Team B has the option of accepting the foul and declining the 10-second runoff, or accepting the foul and the 10-second runoff as would be the normal enforcement. If the runoff is declined, the game clock starts on the snap. If it is accepted, the game clock will start on the ready-for-play signal.  Note: It is never possible to decline a foul and still have a 10-second runoff.

QBA1 is going to be sacked at the B31 in the pocket so he throws the ball into the ground with no eligible receiver in the area. A3 dragged down B3 during the play (1:38).  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-21 on B31. Loss of down for ING, but there is no 10-second runoff, and the game clock will start on the snap. Because the additional foul for offensive holding would result in the clock starting on the snap regardless of whether it is accepted or declined, there is no 10-second runoff for the intentional grounding, or any other illegal act that conserves time.   A.R. 4.62 INTENTIONAL GROUNDING\u2014INTERCEPTION AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Third-and-10 on B45. The score is tied with 1:05 in the fourth quarter. A1 is pressured in the pocket at the A43, and to avoid a sack, throws the ball deep down the left side. There are no eligible A players in the area, although B1 intercepts at the B2 and runs out of bounds there with 0:45 on the clock. Team A is out of timeouts.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B2. The clock is at 0:45 and would start on the snap. Or, A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-22 on A43. Run 10 seconds if B chooses. Set the game clock to 0:35 and wind.   Note: To keep the ball, Team B would have to decline the penalty.  A.R. 4.63 SAFETY\u2014INTENTIONAL GROUNDING\u2014NO 10-SECOND RUNOFF Third-and-10 on A8. Thirteen seconds remain in the game and Team A trails 17-14. QB A1 backpedals into his end zone, and from the pocket, throws the ball into an area with no eligible receiver. There are 8 seconds left on the game clock. Ruling: Safety. Safety kick from the A20. There is no 10-second runoff because the foul results in a score.  A.R. 4.64 ILLEGAL FORWARD PASS\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Third-and-5 on B31. With 10 seconds remaining in the game, and Team B ahead, QB A1 scrambles to his right and throws a pass toward end A2 who is in the end zone. The pass is deflected by B1 and falls incomplete. The ball was thrown from the: (a) B30; (b) B32 after A1 had advanced to the B30 and returned behind the line of scrimmage; or (c) B32 after first throwing a pass from the B36 that B3 deflected back to A1, who caught the ball at the B36 and scrambled to the B32.

A.R. 4.65 FOULING INTENTIONALLY TO STOP CLOCK\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING There are twelve seconds remaining in the game, and Team A is out of timeouts and trails by one point. A1 catches a long pass and is downed at the B12 with four seconds remaining on the clock. A1, realizing that time is about to expire: (a) punches B2; or (b) takes his helmet off (not as part of an injury). Rulings: (a) Unnecessary roughness A1. Ten-second runoff. Game over. (b) Unsportsmanlike conduct A1. Ten-second runoff. Game over.   A.R. 4.66 DEFENSIVE FOUL THAT PREVENTS THE SNAP \u2014 AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Third-and-10 on 50. Team A leads 24-21 with 1:50 remaining in the game and the clock is running. B1: (a) slaps the ball out of center A2\u2019s hands; or (b) misjudges the snap count and encroaches. Rulings: Third-and-5 on the B45 in both (a) and (b). Set the play clock to 40 and start the game clock on the ready-for-play signal, because the game clock was running after the two-minute warning and Team B committed a foul that prevented the snap.  Note: If there were less than 40 seconds left in the half/game, and Team A chooses, the half/game is over. However, if Team B had remaining timeouts, they could use one to prevent the end of the half/game.  A.R. 4.67 TIME OUT MISTAKENLY GRANTED \u2013 AFTER TWO MINUTE WARNING Third-and-10 on B30. The clock is running with 1:50 left in the game, and as the QB approaches the line, (a) A1, or (b) B1, suddenly calls timeout, and the Referee forgets that they have already used their three timeouts in the half and mistakenly grants the timeout.  Rulings: (a) Third-and-15 on B35, run 10 seconds off the game clock, set the play clock to 25, and start the game clock on the ready for play. Team A has intentionally fouled after the two-minute warning, stopping the clock. (Team B could choose to decline the runoff and start the clock on the snap.) (b) Third-and-5 on B25. Set the play clock to 40 seconds and start the game clock on the ready if Team A chooses. Team B has intentionally fouled after the two-minute warning, stopping the clock.   A.R. 4.68 SECOND TIMEOUT IN SAME DEAD BALL PERIOD UNDER TWO MINUTES Third-and-10 on B40. With 1:30 remaining in a tied game, A2 takes a handoff and runs to the B31. After official\u2019s measure, Team A is short of the line-to-gain and Team A calls its first timeout of the half (1:20). As Team A lines up in a scrimmage formation, Team B calls its first timeout. As both teams line up after Team B\u2019s timeout, QBA1 realizes that there are only 10 players on offense and signals for a timeout, which the Umpire grants. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-6 on B36. Delay of game and Team A is charged its second timeout of the half. When a second timeout in the same dead ball period is erroneously granted, there is a 5-yard penalty, and the timeout is also charged. There is no 10-second runoff because the clock was stopped.  EXTENSION OF PERIODS A.R. 4.69 TOO MANY TEAM A PLAYERS ON FIELD ON PUNT\u2014LAST PLAY OF HALF Fourth-and-5 on A25. Team A is leading 21-17 with three seconds remaining in the game.

Team A lines up in punt formation with 12 players on the field. A1 punts the ball to B1 at the B30 who returns it to the A40. Time runs out.  Ruling: B 1-10-A35, extend for an untimed down. The officials should shut this play down before the snap and enforce 5 yards, (no 10 second runoff). But because the officials let the play go on, the penalty is enforced as a foul during the down.

Team B leads 21-13. On the last play of regulation, A1\u2019s pass is complete to A2 for a touchdown. On the ensuing two-point Try from the B2, A1 passes to A3 in the end zone, and A3 pushes off to make the catch. A3 is called for offensive pass interference. Ruling: Re-Try on B12. The Try is an untimed down, so the extension rules do not apply.  A.R. 4.91 DEAD-BALL UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT FOUL AFTER TOUCHDOWN\u2014LAST PLAY OF GAME Fourth-and-12 on B20. Team B is leading 21-14 with three seconds remaining in the game. A1 throws a pass to A2 who catches the ball at the B6 and scores. Following the touchdown, A2 spikes the ball at B2 lying on the ground. Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Team B has the option to enforce the taunting foul on the Try or carry it over to the Overtime kickoff. Either way, the foul counts toward a potential disqualification of A2 for two such fouls.   A.R. 4.92 FAIR-CATCH\u2014END OF HALF Fourth-and-12 on A15. A1 punts to B1 as the half expires. B1 signals and makes a valid fair catch at the 50.

With 0:05 remaining in the game Team A leads 23-20. Kicker A1 punts and B1 signals for a fair catch at the B48 and muffs the ball into the air. B1 catches the ball at the 50 (0:00). Team A had six players on the line of scrimmage at the snap. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A45. Extend for a fair catch kick (due to the valid fair catch) or extend for a play from scrimmage (due to Team A\u2019s illegal formation foul).  A.R. 4.94 FAIR CATCH ON LAST PLAY\u2014PERSONAL FOUL BY TEAM A AFTER CATCH Fourth-and-10 on A10. A1 punts the ball, and B1 signals for a fair catch at the A45. After B1 completes the fair catch, A2 tackles B1. Time in the half expires on the play. Ruling: Extend for a fair-catch kick from the A30, or Team B could decline the extension and have the 15-yard penalty enforced against Team A to start the third quarter. The extension occurs due to the valid fair catch, and the dead ball personal foul by A2 is therefore enforced. There is no option to fair-catch kick from the A45 and carry the 15-yard penalty to the third quarter. (10-2-5)  Note: Had the contact occurred before the catch, there would be an option to run a play from the A30, but there would be no option to carry the foul over to the third quarter.  A.R. 4.95 SAFETY\u2014LAST PLAY OF GAME\u2014FOUL BY TEAM A Fourth-and-10 on A45. Team A is ahead 17-10 with eight seconds remaining in the game. Punter A1 gets the snap and runs backward into A\u2019s end zone where he throws the ball over the end line in an attempt to consume time. During the play, A2 held B1 at the line of scrimmage. Time expires on the play. Ruling: Safety. Game over. Team A wins 17-12. The foul by A2 on the last play of the game does not extend the period, because the ball was never punted, so there is nothing to create an extension opportunity. A safety does not create an extension, unless that safety is caused by a foul, or there is a personal foul (by the offense) on a play that ends in a safety. Throwing the ball over the end line by A1 to consume time, (as opposed to \u201cconserve\u201d time), is not a foul.

On the ensuing 2-point Try, Runner A2 is driven out of bounds at the B\u00bd-yard line, and B2 hits him late out of bounds. Ruling: Game over. Team B wins 34-33. There is no extension or enforcement of the dead ball foul, as it would be enforced on the kickoff. There would be no replay of the Try attempt, regardless of the remaining time on the clock.  A.R. 4.100 DELAY OF GAME AT END OF GAME\u2014SPIKE Third-and-10 on B20. With 0:03 left in a tied game, A1\u2019s pass is knocked down by B1 at the B7. B1 immediately scoops the ball up and forcibly throws it downfield in celebration. Time expires on the play. Ruling: Go to overtime. The foul is not enforced. This is a dead-ball delay of game penalty, but not an unsportsmanlike conduct or unnecessary roughness foul that would be enforced on the overtime kickoff.  A.R. 4.101 LIVE BALL PERSONAL FOUL ON LAST PLAY OF QUARTER/HALF Second-and-10 on B40. QBA1 scrambles to the B30 where he is tackled. A4 commits an illegal peel back block on the line of scrimmage. Time expires on the play: (a) at the end of the first/third quarter; or (b) at the end of either half.  Rulings:  (a) Second-and-25 on A45 to begin the second/fourth quarter. There is no option to extend the quarter for an offensive foul. (b) Half over. A live ball foul (by either team) cannot be carried over to the second half or overtime.   MISCELLANEOUS A.R. 4.102 FAILURE BY OFFICIALS TO ENFORCE PENALTY YARDAGE Second-and-10 on B30. On the last play of the first half, quarterback A1 throws an incomplete pass, but B2 was offside on the play. The penalty is accepted and the half is extended for an untimed down, on which Team A attempts, but misses, a field goal with the ball snapped from the B30. It is then discovered that the officials did not mark off the five-yard penalty. Ruling: Half over. Once a legal snap or kick has occurred a penalty enforcement cannot be corrected.  A.R. 4.103 DELAY OF GAME AT END OF PLAY\u2014SPIKE First-and-10 on B40. A1\u2019s pass is intercepted by B1 who runs it back to the A40. After being tackled, while still on the ground, B1 forcefully throws the ball downfield. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A45. Dead-ball foul.  A.R. 4.104 SPIKE AT END OF PLAY IN END ZONE First-and-10 on B20. A1 throws a pass into the end zone, where: (a) A2; or (b) B2, almost catches the pass, but drops it. In disgust: (a) A2; or (b) B2, picks up the ball and forcibly spikes it into the ground in the end zone. Rulings: (a) and (b): Second-and-10 on B20. No foul when done by either A or B in the end zone or out of bounds, as long as it is not directed at an opponent.   A.R. 4.105 BACKWARD PASS IN END ZONE ON LAST PLAY OF GAME Third-and-12 on B15. On the last play of the game, B leads 23-20, and B2 intercepts a pass in the end zone and immediately throws the ball in the air in celebration. The ball goes backward and is recovered by A5 in the end zone.  Ruling: Touchdown A, game over. Do not attempt the Try.

Before the snap, Team A shifts to a normal formation with center #67 in the middle of the line, and successfully kicks the Try.  Ruling: Re-Try kick on B20 or 2-point Try on B7. When #67 reports as eligible, he must participate in an eligible position. The shift puts him in an ineligible position, which creates an illegal formation.

At the end of the down, it is discovered that: (a) withdrawn offensive player A2 had cleared the field on the opponents\u2019 sideline or over the end line; or (b) withdrawn defensive player B1 had cleared the field on the opponents\u2019 sideline or over the end line.  Rulings:  (a) Option: Third-and-17 on A35, or fourth-and-7 on A45. Live-ball foul enforced at the previous spot. (5-2-6)  (b) Third-and-7 on A45. Live-ball foul enforced at the previous spot. (5-2-6)  Note: The penalty for leaving the field on the opponent\u2019s sideline is a live ball foul that occurs at the snap and thus penalized from the previous spot. Therefore, a team could call a timeout before the snap to save themselves from the penalty. (5-2-8-(e))   A.R. 5.14 SUBSTITUTION AFTER SNAP\u2014INTERFERENCE WITH PLAY Third-and-14 on A35. Team B makes a situational substitution sending four players into the game, however five players leave the field. Following the snap, B11 realizes he should be in the game and re-enters the field of play. Shortly after B11 enters the game, A1 passes into B11\u2019s area, and B11 breaks up the pass at the 50-yard line. Ruling: First-and-10 on 50, or whatever result the crew determines to be appropriate. Palpably unfair act.  Note: Since B11 entered the field and had an immediate effect on the play, it is a palpably unfair act. If B11 had covered a different receiver and had not had a direct and immediate effect on the play, a five-yard penalty for illegal substitution would be enforced from the previous spot.  A.R. 5.15 SUBSTITUTE ENTERS FIELD BEFORE SNAP\u2014OFFENSE Third-and-3 on A40. The offense has 10 players on the field. Prior to the snap, A11 (who had not participated in the previous play) enters the field to participate in the play and: (a) enters past the numbers and sets in a legal position for one second before the snap; (b) stays in motion backward as the ball is snapped, and he is behind the tight end at the snap. A2 runs to the A45.  Rulings:  (a) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A45. Legal play if Team A has seven players on the line of scrimmage.  (b) Third-and-8 on A35. Illegal shift. This would convert to a false start after the two-minute warning of a half and create the potential for a 10-second runoff. (7-4-6). In either (a) or (b), if this occurs before the two-minute warning, the Umpire should hold up play until the defense has the opportunity to match up.  A.R. 5.16 SUBSTITUTE ENTERS FIELD BEFORE/AFTER SNAP\u2014DEFENSE Third-and-3 on A35.

Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A37. Illegal touch and recovery by Team A.

Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A44. Since A2\u2019s recovery at the A46 is a legal recovery, there is no option to enforce the five-yard penalty from the dead-ball spot.

A1 blocks him out of the way before the ball arrives, and A2 catches the ball there.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A47. Since the ball was kicked into the ground, Team B is not permitted to signal for a fair catch, and they do not have the right to an unhindered opportunity to catch the kick. Team A is allowed to block after 10 yards, because the ball hit the ground, and they are allowed to push or pull an opponent in an attempt to recover a ball which they may legally recover. Team A would decline the option to enforce a five-yard penalty from the spot of the illegal signal (B\u2019s ball) and would take possession at the spot where the kick was recovered.   A.R. 6.8 ONSIDE KICK\u2014MULTIPLE TEAM A FOULS On a surprise onside kick in the third quarter from the A35, Kicker A1 kicks the ball directly into the air. B1 is in position to catch the kick at the A44, but A2 interferes with the ball or B1. The ball then (a) goes out of bounds at the A46, last touched by A2; (b) is recovered by B2 at the 50; (c) goes to the A46 where it is recovered by A2; or (d) goes to the A42 where it is recovered by A2. Rulings:  (a), (b), and (c) B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on A29. Interference with the opportunity to catch a kick. B can cross his restraining line in an effort to catch the kick. A2 committed interference with the opportunity to catch a kick when he interfered with the ball or B1.  (d) B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on A27. Interference with the opportunity to catch a kick. The ball belongs to Team B at the A42 because it did not reach the A45 and Team B did not touch the ball before recovery, so the penalty can be enforced from that spot.  A.R. 6.9 ONSIDE KICK\u2014AIRBORNE CONTROL BY TEAM A\u2014LANDS OUT OF BOUNDS A1 attempts an onside kick from the A35. The ball bounces and goes into the air. As the ball is airborne near the sideline at the A46, A2 jumps up and controls the ball there. Before A2 comes to the ground, he is pushed out of bounds where he maintains control of the ball when he hits the ground. A2 would have landed inbounds.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A46. This is a kickoff out of bounds, because A2 did not complete the process of the catch inbounds. Team B would take the ball at the dead ball spot, as it is more beneficial than 25 yards from the spot of the kick.  A.R. 6.10 ONSIDE KICK\u2014BLOCK BY TEAM A WITHIN 10 YARDS On a grounded onside kick from the A35, A1 blocks B1 above the waist at the A43 while the ball is rolling at the A46. A2 falls on the ball at the A47. Ruling: Rekick A25. Illegal block. Kickers may not block an opponent in the first 10 yards until the ball has been touched by a Team B player, unless that player is actively trying to obstruct him. The location of the ball at the time of the block is irrelevant. Team B must accept the penalty and have a rekick, or the ball would belong to Team A, because Team A is in legal possession at the end of the down.

While the ball was rolling at the A44, A1 blocks B1 high at the A46. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A47. Legal block and recovery. The block occurred beyond 10 yards after the ball hit the ground, thus the block was legal.

While the ball was rolling at the A44, A1 blocks B1 high at the A46. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A47. Legal block and recovery. The block occurred beyond 10 yards after the ball hit the ground, thus the block was legal.  Note: In blocking on a free kick, the location of the ball is irrelevant. The key issues to the legality of the block are the location of the block, and whether the ball has hit the ground or has been legally touched.   A.R. 6.12 ONSIDE KICK\u2014MULTIPLE FOULS BY TEAM A On an onside kick into the ground from the A35, A1 blocks B1 high at the A44 while the ball is at the A42.

Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B38. No foul for a kickoff out of bounds, since A2 is deemed not to have touched the ball. It is a legal bat, because the ball was batted backward.  A.R. 6.14 ONSIDE KICK\u2014TEAM A ILLEGAL FORMATION On an onside kick from the A35, A3 is moving his feet forward before the kick but is not offside. A4 then recovers the kick at the A47.

Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B48. Team B would decline the foul for a kickoff out of bounds, unless the ball went out of bounds more than 25 yards from the spot of the kick.   A.R. 6.16 ONSIDE KICK\u2014DOUBLE AND MULTIPLE FOULS On an onside kick from the A35, the ball rolls to the A43 where A1 muffs it, and the ball rolls out of bounds at the A44. After A1 muffed the ball, and before it went out of bounds, B2 blocked A3 below the waist at the A42. Ruling: Rekick A35. Illegal touch and kickoff out of bounds by Team A; low block by Team B. It is not a 5 vs. 15 enforcement, because neither the illegal touch nor the kick-off out of bounds are simple five-yard penalties, and because there was a change of possession on the play.  A.R. 6.17 ONSIDE KICK\u2014DOUBLE FOUL\u2014KICKOFF OUT OF BOUNDS/CLIP On an onside kick from the A35, the ball goes out of bounds at the A48. B1 clips while the ball is rolling toward the sideline. Ruling: Re-kick A35. The kickoff out of bounds and clipping offset. It is not a 5 vs.15 enforcement, as the result of the play is a change of possession, and because a kickoff out of bounds is not a simple five-yard penalty.  A.R. 6.18 ONSIDE KICK\u2014LEGAL RECOVERY BY TEAM A\u2014DOUBLE FOUL  On an onside kick from the A35, A2 is offside. A1 recovers at the A47, and B1 tackles A1 by the facemask. Ruling: Rekick 50. Double foul (5 vs. 15) applies, as there was no change of possession. Enforce B\u2019s foul from the previous spot and rekick.   A.R. 6.19 ONSIDE KICK\u2014DOUBLE FOUL\u2014ILLEGAL TOUCH/LOW BLOCK On an onside kick from the A35, A1 is the first to touch the kick at the A42, and A2 then recovers the kick at the A46. During the kick, B1 blocks A3 below the waist at the A44.  Ruling: Rekick at the A35. This is not a 5 vs. 15 enforcement, because the illegal touch is not a simple five-yard penalty.  FREE KICK\u2014BALL GOING OUT OF BOUNDS A.R. 6.20 KICKOFF OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014LAST TOUCHED BY TEAM B On a kickoff from the A35, the ball rolls out of bounds at the B12 after first touching A1 and then B1. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B12. The receiving team last touched the ball, and A1\u2019s touch was legal.  A.R. 6.21 SAFETY KICK OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014LAST TOUCHED BY TEAM A A1 free kicks from the A20 following a safety. The kick is muffed at the B40 by B1, is touched by A3, and it then rolls out of bounds at the B35. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. If a safety kick goes out of bounds (untouched or last touched by A), the ball is placed at the out of bounds spot or 30 yards from the spot of the kick, whichever is better for Team B.  A.R. 6.22  ONSIDE KICK OUT OF BOUNDS ON KICKOFF FROM B35 B1 commits a personal foul on a touchdown run by A1, and then during the subsequent successful Try, B2 also commits a personal foul.

In both (a) and (b), B4 is tackled at the B18; or (c) as B4 caught the kick in the end zone and took a knee.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B11. When the foul is during the kick, the 15-yard penalty is enforced from the spot where the players formed the wedge. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B9. When the illegal Wedge (or illegal double-team) occurs during the return, enforcement is normal enforcement on a running play, (spot of the foul or dead ball spot).  (c) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B11. On a touchback, an illegal wedge is penalized 15 yards from the spot where the players formed the wedge.  Note: If two or more players intentionally align shoulder-to-shoulder within two yards of each other and move forward together, it is an illegal wedge at that point; actual contact with an opponent is not necessary. Additionally, if two or more players, at least one of whom did not start in the set-up zone, block and make contact with an opponent at the same time, it is an illegal double-team block. If the foul occurs during the kick, enforcement is from the spot of the foul. If the foul occurs during the return, the penalty is enforced as a foul on a running play. If the foul occurs in the receiving team\u2019s end zone during the kick, it is enforced from the previous spot.  A.R. 6.33 KICKOFF\u2014TEAM B DOUBLE TEAM BLOCK On a kickoff from the A35, B3 is one of eight players in the setup zone at the time of the kick. After the kick is caught by B1, B3 double-team blocks (a) A2 at the B45, with teammate B4 who also was in the setup zone when the ball was kicked, or (b) A2 at the B30, with teammate B5 who originally lined up as one of 3 players positioned outside of the setup zone when the ball was kicked. B1 returns the kick to the B35. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-ten on the B35. No foul for 2 players blocking an opponent together who were both in the setup zone at the time the ball is kicked. They may double-team block an opponent together, anywhere on the field, though they may not form a wedge. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-ten on the B15. It is a foul for an illegal double team block if 2 or more players of the receiving team block an opponent together, if they weren\u2019t both in the setup zone when the ball was kicked. The 15-yard penalty is enforced as a foul on a running play in this case, as it happened during the return. If it happened during the kick, it would be enforced from the spot of the foul. This is a personal foul.   Note: As described, (a) is a legal double team block, and (b) is an illegal double team block. In either case, had the two players come together, shoulder to shoulder, within two yards of each other, and moved forward together (with or without contacting an opponent), it would be an illegal wedge. Enforcement is the same, but an illegal wedge is prohibited by any two Team B players, while an illegal double team block is prohibited if one of the two players did not start in the setup zone.

Fair catch interference. Extend the period for a fair-catch kick or a snap from scrimmage. If B1 had completed the catch and then A1 tackled him, the period could only be extended for a fair catch kick after the dead ball foul was enforced, or B could elect to not extend and have the foul enforced on the kickoff to start the second half.   A.R. 6.38 DELAY OF KICKOFF The Back Judge hands the ball to the kicker for a kickoff at the A35 and winds the 25-second play clock. The kicker does not begin to move towards the ball before the play clock hits zero. Ruling: Kickoff A30. Delay of kickoff.  Note: If the kicker has started toward the ball before the play clock hits :00, delay of kickoff should not be called.   A.R. 6.39 TWELVE MEN ON THE FIELD AT THE TIME OF READY-FOR-PLAY SIGNAL Team A lines up for a kickoff from the A35. The Back Judge starts the play clock, and officials then discover that Team A has 12 men lined up for the kickoff. Ruling: Kickoff A30. Too many men in the formation. If either team has more than 11 men in the formation with the play clock running, the officials should blow their whistles immediately and not allow the kick.  A.R. 6.40 ONSIDE KICK\u2014DOUBLE FOUL WITH A CHANGE On a grounded onside kick from the A35, A1 blocks B1 at the A43 while the ball is at the A44. B2 then recovers the ball at the A43 and returns it to the A20. During the return, B3 blocks A3 below the waist at the A30. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A45, or Team B can choose to replay the down. This is a double foul with a change of possession. A1\u2019s block is illegal because it occurred in the first 10 yards, and the ball had not been legally touched. The location of the ball when the block occurs is irrelevant.  A.R. 6.41 SAFETY KICK\u2014KICKER GOES OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014TEAM A RECOVERY With 1:30 remaining in the game, A1 punts a safety kick from the A20. B1 signals for a fair catch at the B40 and muffs the ball, which rolls to the B46. A2 steps on the sideline at the 50, returns inbounds with both feet, pushes B1 in the back, and recovers the ball at the B46. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B46. As with a kickoff, A is eligible to touch/recover after it goes 10 yards. It is not a foul for A2 being out of bounds, because he isn\u2019t avoiding a block. A2\u2019s touching after being out of bounds is legal, because the kicked ball had been touched by an opponent. The push in the back is legal, as A2 is making a personal attempt to recover the ball, and the kick is no longer in flight.  A.R. 6.42 KICKER GOES OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014TEAM A RECOVERY On an onside kick from the A35, A2 touches the ball at the A46, and A2 then recovers the ball at the A44.

On free kicks, a member of the kicking team who has been out of bounds cannot touch the kick until the ball has been touched by a member of the receiving team. The illegal touching foul cannot be enforced from the dead ball spot, because Team A is in legal possession at the end of the down. The foul for illegal touching must be enforced from the previous spot. If A2 had stepped out of bounds to avoid a block, it would also be a foul for voluntarily going out of bounds.

A.R. 6.43 KICKING TEAM OFFSIDE ON KICKOFF\u2014KICK OUT OF BOUNDS On a kickoff from the A35, A5 is offside. The kick goes out of bounds, untouched, at the B32. Ruling: Re-kick A30 for the offside, or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B40 for the kickoff out of bounds.  Note: The five-yard penalty for offside cannot be added on from the B40, because only one of the fouls, (kickoff out of bounds, and offside), can be enforced.

The kickoff out of bounds foul is declined (B\u2019s ball 25 yards from the spot of the kick), and the offside penalty is enforced from the dead-ball spot.

He is at the A34 when the ball is kicked. The ball is kicked thru the end zone. Ruling: Re-kick A30, or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. This is a foul for illegal formation by the kicking team. Kicking team members must remain in their position with one foot on the yard line behind the kicker\u2019s restraining line, from the time the kicker approaches the ball, until the ball is kicked.  A.R. 6.47 KICKOFF\u2014DOUBLE FOUL AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION A1\u2019s kickoff from the A35 is caught by B1 at: (a) the B2; or (b) in B\u2019s end zone. B1 returns the ball to the B45 where A1 tackles him by the facemask. During the return, B2 held A5 at the B30.  Rulings:  (a) and (b) B\u2019s ball, 1st-and-10 on the B30.

During the return, B2 held A5 at: (a) the B30 or (b) the 50.  Rulings: (a)  B\u2019s ball, first-and-ten at the B30. This is a double foul after a change of possession, and the spot of Team B\u2019s foul is less advantageous for Team B than the dead ball spot. (b)  B\u2019s ball, first-and-ten at the B40. The least advantageous spot for Team B is the dead ball spot.

Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and 10 B22. This is a legal bat by B1, since it was backward, and A2 is deemed not to have touched the ball, since it was batted into him. It is therefore not a \u201ckickoff out of bounds last touched by Team A\u201d.

A.R. 6.51 KICKOFF A35\u2014TEAM B PLAYER ENTERS SETUP ZONE BEFORE KICK On an onside kick from the A35, Team B has nine players in the setup zone and player B3 is on the B39, just outside the setup zone.

As the kicker approaches the ball, the wind blows the ball off the tee. Team A brings A1, the widest man, from outside the yard-line numbers in to be the holder. This leaves Team A with just one player outside the yard-line numbers on that side. The ball is kicked through the end zone.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30 or re-kick A30.

Even though the holder counts toward either side for the purpose of five on each side, Team A must still have two players outside the yard-line numbers and two players, (other than the holder), between the inbounds line and the yard-line numbers.

The ball hits the ground in front of return man B7 at the B10, where he picks it up and runs it to the 50. A2 pushes B3 in the back (a) at the B40 while the kick is in the air; (b) at the B17 as he scrambles for the ball after it has hit the ground; or (c) at the B20 while B7 is running with the ball. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A40 or re-kick after 10-yard penalty. Team A may not block in the back while the ball is in the air during a free kick. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. There is no foul for a block in the back when a player is making a personal attempt to recover a loose ball he is eligible to touch or recover. (c) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. There is no foul for the kicking team blocking in the back during the return, as they are now the defense.  A.R 6.58 KICKER GOES OUT OF BOUNDS TO AVOID BLOCK On an onside kick from the A35, the ball bounces into the ground and then high into the air toward the sideline. B2 steps forward to block A7 near the sideline at the A43, to allow B4 to attempt to catch the kick behind him. A7 goes around B2\u2019s block by stepping on the sideline at the A43 and re-establishing inbounds at the A45. B4 muffs the kick and A7 recovers the ball at the A46. Ruling: Re-kick A30. A kicking team player may not go out of bounds to avoid a block, until the ball is touched by the receiving team, or the kick ends. This is a foul on a free kick, and a five-yard penalty. There is no option to enforce the penalty from the dead ball spot, because A is in legal possession at the end of the down. There is no foul for A7 touching the ball after being out of bounds, because it was touched by B before the recovery. If B had recovered, the yardage could be enforced from the dead ball spot.  A.R. 6.59 KICKOFF\u2014USE OF DECOY KICKER On a free kick from the A35, Team A lines up in a legal formation with six players to the left side of the ball and five on the right, all within one yard of the A35. The two players nearest the ball are bunched close so it is not clear which one is the kicker. The inside man on the left side (the sixth player on that side) begins approaching the ball as if he is going to kick it. Instead, he runs past the ball and lines up stationary on the right side at the A34. Another player from the right side then begins his approach and kicks the ball into the ground. At the time the second player began his approach to the ball, there are 5 players stationary, each with a foot on the 34-yard line, on each side of the ball.

The \u201cdecoy\u201d player was not the \u201ckicker\u201d, and the formation must be legal when the actual kicker begins his approach to the ball.  RULE 7 BALL IN PLAY, DEAD BALL, SCRIMMAGE ENCROACHMENT/DELAY OF GAME DEFENSE A.R. 7.1 DELAY BY THE DEFENSE\u2014ABRUPT MOVEMENT Third-and-10 on B30. While Team A is at the line of scrimmage, and A1 is calling signals, defensive tackle B1: (a) abruptly moves in an effort to cause A2 to false start; or (b) misjudges the snap signal and moves forward into the neutral zone, but backs out before the snap. There is no reaction by Team A players. Rulings: (a) Third-and-5 on B25. Delay of game, defense. Blow the whistle and kill the play immediately, whether A2 or any offensive player reacts. (b) No foul.  A.R. 7.2 ENCROACHMENT\u2014NOT ILLEGAL SNAP Fourth-and-5 on 50. Nose guard B1 is lined up on the defensive side of the line of scrimmage with his right hand directly in front of the ball. Center A1 moves the ball forward a couple of inches in a normal snapping motion and contacts B1\u2019s hand. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B45. Team B is not allowed to interfere with the normal snapping motion of the ball by the center. If, in the opinion of the officials, this is not a normal snapping motion, the foul would be on the offense for an illegal snap, but in either case, the play would be shut down. (7-4-3)  NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION A.R. 7.3 NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION\u2014UNIMPEDED PATH Fourth-and-1 on B40. Defensive end B2 penetrates deep beyond the neutral zone and has an unimpeded path toward the quarterback, punter, or field-goal kicker. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B35. Blow the play dead immediately. Neutral Zone Infraction. Whenever a defensive player gets offside and is continuing forward before the snap, the play should be killed for a neutral zone infraction.  A.R. 7.4 DEFENSIVE PLAYER MOVES INTO NZ\u2014STOPS\u2014BACKS OUT AT SNAP Second-and-10 on A30. Defensive left end B2 takes two quick steps into the neutral zone and is even with RT A3, but stops and starts to back out when the ball is snapped. No offensive players react and A1 throws an incomplete pass. Ruling: Second-and-5 on A35. Defense offside. Since the defensive player stopped his forward movement, the play is not shut down for unimpeded to the quarterback and is penalized as defense offside.  A.R. 7.5 ELIGIBLE ON THE LINE MOVES FORWARD/BACKWARD JUST PRIOR TO SNAP Second-and-5 on B40. Wideout A2, on the line of scrimmage, takes a slight step forward or backward just prior to the snap.

QBA1 walks forward from a shotgun position toward the line of scrimmage to call an audible. The ball is snapped while A1 is moving and is recovered by A2 who runs out of bounds at the A45.  Ruling: Second-and-8 on A35. If the QB is moving toward the line of scrimmage at the snap it is a foul for illegal motion, and the ball remains alive.

Back A4, who is lined up as the deep back, gives signals by moving his arms while A2 is in motion; (b) LG A5 who is looking back at the QB, turns and taps the center. A3 runs to the A31. Ruling: (a) and (b) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A31. The action by A4 and A5 is legal.   A.R. 7.22 ILLEGAL SHIFT First-and-10 on B30. As team A breaks the huddle, wideout A2 goes to the wrong side of the formation, and before he sets, Quarterback A1 tells him to go to the other side of the formation. All other Team A players had been set for one second. The ball is snapped while A2 is still moving two yards outside of the tackle. The pass is complete to A2 at the B5.

As Team A comes to the line, split end A2 is clearly two yards off the line of scrimmage, leaving ineligible A4 as the end man on the line of scrimmage. As quarterback A1 calls signals: (a) Team A executes a designed shift, moving A2 up to the line \u201ccovering\u201d ineligible A4, and tailback A3 moves into the slot, two yards off the line of scrimmage; or (b) before the ball is snapped, A2 realizes that he is lined up in the wrong place, so he moves up to the line, \u201ccovering\u201d ineligible A4. After a full second, the ball is snapped, and A1 scrambles to the B20. Rulings: (a) Third-and-15 on B45. Illegal formation. Offense must present a legal formation both before and after a shift.

Runner A1 goes around end and is knocked off balance by B1 at the B28. A1 staggers and falls to a knee at the B26, fumbles, and A3 recovers at the B20. Ruling: Fourth-and-2 on B26. Down by contact.   A.R. 7.26 RUNNER SLIDES TO GIVE HIMSELF UP - FEET FIRST/SIDEWAYS/HEADFIRST Third-and-10 on A15. QB A1 scrambles out of the pocket and runs up field. As he nears the A25 he sees that he is going to be tackled so he (a) slides feet first with the ball at the A23, (b) slides sideways with the ball at the 23 \u00bd, or (c) dives headfirst and his right knee hits the ground with the ball at the A24 and he slides to the A25. In (a), (b) and (c), he is not contacted by a defender. Rulings: (a) Fourth-and-2 on A23. (b) Fourth-and-1\u00bd on A23\u00bd. (c) Fourth-and-1 on A24.  Note: When a runner intentionally goes to the ground, he is afforded protection from defensive contact to his body, (if the slide was early enough), and always to the head and neck area. The ball is placed where it was when the runner\u2019s first body part other than a hand or foot, hits the ground.  A.R. 7.27 DOWN BY CONTACT/OR NOT - SLIDING RUNNER  Third-and-goal on A5. Runner A3 (any player in possession of the football) goes to the ground as he is trying to reach the goal line. The ball is at the one-yard line when A3\u2019s knee touches the ground, and A3 then slides untouched into the end zone with the ball. (a) A3 intentionally went to the ground, sliding feet first toward the goal line; (b) A3 intentionally went to the ground, diving head first toward the goal line with the ball stretched ahead of him; (c) A3 stumbled at the 5-yard line, which caused him to unintentionally go to the ground, before sliding across the goal line; or (d) A3 simulates going to the ground by starting a slide at the B3, remains upright, and runs into the end zone.  Rulings:  (a) Fourth-and-goal on A1. Because A3 intentionally went to the ground, the ball is down at the forward point of the ball at the time a body part other than A3\u2019s hand or foot touches the ground.  (b) Fourth-and-goal on A1. Whether a runner slides feet first or headfirst, if the runner goes to the ground intentionally, the ball is down at the forward point of the ball at the time a body part other than A3\u2019s hand or foot touches the ground.  (c) Touchdown A, kickoff A35. Because A3 did not intentionally go to the ground, he is not down by contact until touched down by a defender. Therefore, when he slides across the goal line with the ball, untouched by a defender, it is a touchdown. (d) Fourth-and-goal on B3. When a runner simulates sliding feet or head first, the ball is dead when he begins to simulate the slide.   A.R. 7.28 DOWN BY CONTACT/OR NOT\u2014IN AIR COLLISION WITH OPPONENT First-and-10 on A40. A2 and B3 both jump up at the B30 in a legal attempt to catch a pass and collide in midair: (a) A2 controls the ball and immediately falls down at the B30. He gets up and runs to the B20; (b) they fall separately after the collision, after which A2 controls the pass and falls to the ground. He gets up and runs to the B15; (c) they fall to the ground without the ball, and the ball is lying on B3\u2019s back (ball has not touched the ground). A2 reaches over and takes the ball off B3\u2019s back and runs to the B20. Rulings:  (a) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. Down by contact.  (b) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B15. Legal advance.

The ball slides out of A1\u2019s hand and rests on his arm while A1 is on the ground. B1, while on his feet, reaches in, picks up the ball, and is tackled at the 50. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. Runner A1 is not down by contact as he did not have possession of the ball when B1 took it. Team B may advance with the fumble.

During the scramble for the loose ball, the Back Judge erroneously blows the whistle. B2 falls on the ball at the B45. During A2\u2019s run, (a) A4 holds at the A38; or (b) A4 clips at the A38. Rulings: (a) Second-and-15 on A30. If Team A elects to replay the down, the offensive hold is disregarded, and the down is replayed. The game clock is reset to what it was at the time of the snap, and it then starts on the snap. If Team A chooses to put the ball in play where possession was lost, the offensive hold will be enforced as normal, which results in second-and-17 on A28, the clock is reset to what it was at the time of the fumble, and the clock starts on the ready for play.  (b) Second-and-22 on A23. If Team A elects to put the ball in play where possession was lost, the foul is enforced as normal from the A38, the game clock is reset to what it was at the time of the fumble, and it starts on the ready for play. If Team A elects to replay the down, the personal foul is enforced from the previous spot, which results in second-and-30 on A15, the game clock is reset to what it was at the time of the snap, and it then starts on the snap.  Note: If the down is replayed after an erroneous whistle, only personal fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct fouls are enforced, and by rule, they are enforced from the previous spot. If the down is not replayed, all fouls are enforced as normal.  A.R. 7.35 ERRONEOUS WHISTLE\u2014FUMBLE OWN END ZONE Second-and-16 on A6. The clock is running, and the ball is snapped at 1:25 in the 4th quarter. A1\u2019s fumble at the A5 rolls into the end zone.

The back Judge erroneously blows the whistle during the fumble when the ball is at the B47. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B45.

(a) A2 clips in the end zone before the whistle blew or (b) A2 holds in the end zone before the whistle blew. Rulings:  (a) Second-and-18 on A3. Team A will elect to replay the down, so the game clock is reset to what it was at the time of the snap, the play clock is set to 25 seconds, and the game clock starts on the snap. If the down is replayed, as it is here, the only fouls that are enforced are UNR/UNS, and the enforcement is from the previous spot.  (b) Second-and-15 on A6. Team A will elect to replay the down, so the game clock is reset to what it was at the time of the snap, the play clock is set to 25 seconds, and the game clock starts on the snap. Since the down is being replayed, and only unsportsmanlike conduct and unnecessary roughness fouls are enforced on a replay of the down, the holding foul is not enforced.   Note: If the down is replayed due to an erroneous whistle, by rule, any fouls that are enforced are done so from the previous spot, rather than from their normal enforcement spot, had there not been an erroneous whistle.

Holder A1 is kneeling as the apparent holder for a field-goal attempt. He extends his hands, but the snap goes to kicker A2 who throws a forward pass to end A3 who catches it in the end zone. Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. (7-6-4)  A.R. 7.49   RUNNER TAKES HIS HELMET OFF Second-and-5 on B45. QBA1 completes a pass to end A2 at the B20 with no defenders in the area. A2 then runs toward the goal line, and at the B5, he takes his helmet off in celebration and holds it up in the air and backs into the end zone. He then crosses the goal line.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-ten on B20. The ball is dead by rule when the runner\u2019s helmet comes off at the B5. A2\u2019s actions are also taunting. That foul is enforced from the dead ball spot, and it is first-and-10 after enforcement. The foul is the first qualifying foul toward potential disqualification of A2.   A.R. 7.50 PASS STRIKES OFFICIAL\u2019S FLAG Second-and-5 on A40. QBA1 from the pocket throws a pass toward end A2 at the B40 yard line near the sideline. Prior to the pass, B2 chucked A2 at the A48 yard line with QBA1 still in the pocket. The Side Judge throws his flag, and the pass hits the official\u2019s flag in flight and falls incomplete at the B40.  Ruling: Second-and-5 on A40. An official\u2019s flag in flight is considered \u201cany other object\u201d and the down is replayed by rule. The game clock is reset to the time at the snap, the play clock is set to 25 seconds, and the game clock will start on the snap. Personal and unsportsmanlike conduct fouls are enforced from the previous spot. All other fouls are disregarded.   A.R. 7.51 BALL PLACEMENT AFTER TURNOVER ON DOWNS Fourth-and-2 on B4. The forward point of the ball is on the four-yard line. A1 carries the ball but is stopped for no gain. The forward point of the ball is still on the four-yard line. Ruling: Though possession of the ball has changed, the position of the ball remains where it became dead. The chains are moved to be aligned with what has become the forward point of the ball, which is between the four and five-yard line.   RULE 8 FORWARD PASS, BACKWARD PASS, FUMBLE The following mechanics and interpretations pertain to Offensive Pass Interference and Illegal Contact:  (a) Actions by eligible receivers, such as pushing off to gain separation and blocking downfield before the pass is touched, are Offensive Pass Interference and will be strictly enforced. (b) When the official sees illegal contact, he/she will look to the quarterback. If the quarterback is out of the pocket, or if the ball is clearly in the air, illegal contact will not be called, though it may be a foul for defensive pass interference. (c) If the quarterback still has the ball or is in the throwing motion, or if he is in the process of being sacked, illegal contact (quarterback in the pocket) will be called.  FORWARD PASS\u2014COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE A.R. 8.1 COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE First-and-10 on A20. A2 leaps to catch a pass at the A31, touches one foot there, and drags the other at the A30. A2 is contacted by B1 at the A31 and falls out of bounds. He does not lose the ball on contact with the ground. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 at A31. Completed catch.

A2 dives for the ball and controls the ball in the air. The first thing to hit the ground is the point of the ball. (a) A2 briefly loses control of the ball when it hits the ground; or (b) A2 never loses control of the ball. (c) The ball moves slightly within control of A2              Rulings: (a) Third-and-5 on A35. Incomplete pass. (b) First-and-10 on A40. The receiver never lost control of the ball, so this is a catch. (c) First-and -10 on A40. If the ball moves within control of the receiver, he is deemed not to have lost control of the ball, and it is a completed pass.

A pass is thrown to the sideline where A2 controls the ball with one foot inbounds and hops on the same foot inbounds prior to landing out of bounds. Ruling: Third-and-5 on A40. Both feet did not touch inbounds.  A.R. 8.14 INCOMPLETE PASS\u2014SECOND STEP ON PLAYER First-and-10 on B25. A2 jumps up to catch a pass at the B10 and comes down near the sideline. A2\u2019s left foot lands on the ground, and his right foot comes down on B2 who is laying on the ground. A2\u2019s next step is out of bounds. Ruling: Second-and-10 on B25. Incomplete pass.  A.R. 8.15 INCOMPLETE PASS\u2014ROLLS OVER ON PLAYER\u2014LANDS OUT OF BOUNDS First-and-10 on B25. A2 jumps up to catch a pass in the back of the end zone.

In an effort to intercept a pass at the B45, B2, who is standing with one foot on the sideline and the other inbounds, jumps up in the air and gains control of the ball. B2 then comes down to the ground with both feet inbounds and carries the ball out of bounds at the B45. Ruling: Third-and-10 on A40. Incomplete pass, as B2 is considered out of bounds when he touches the ball the first time. The play is dead when B2 first touches the pass.

B3 jumps from out of bounds and touches the ball in A4's hands before A4 gets his second foot to the ground. After A4 comes to the ground, he runs for a touchdown. (a) The ball was still loose when B3 touched it; or (b) the ball was held securely in A4\u2019s hands throughout.  Rulings:  (a)  Second-and-10 on B47. Incomplete pass, because the ball was not in player control when it touched something that was out of bounds. (b) Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. The touching by B3 does not put the ball out of bounds because it was in player control.  Note: The result is the same if this occurs in the end zone.

As he is striding to take his second step, he reaches the ball out in his right hand and it hits the pylon. His right foot then hits the ground in bounds, and then the rest of his body lands in bounds in the end zone, where he maintains control of the ball. Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. The ball touching the pylon does not put the ball out of bounds because it was in player control.  A.R. 8.19 PASS COMPLETE\u2014FOOT TOUCHES PYLON Second-and-10 on B30. A1 throws a forward pass high to A2 near the sideline. A2 controls the ball in the air and gets one foot down inbounds. His second foot touches the pylon and then touches down in the end zone.

The ball is knocked out of A1\u2019s hand by B1 and recovered by B2 at the A25 where he is touched down. A1 had brought the ball all the way down to his waist and then started to bring it back up to throw when it was knocked loose.  Rulings: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A25. If the ball is knocked loose as the passer is attempting to \u201cre-cock\u201d his arm it is a fumble. If he brings his arm all the way back up, the passing motion begins again once he starts to bring his hand forward with control and ends when he begins to tuck it back to his body.

A2 goes high to catch the pass, secures possession while in the air, but is then pushed by B1 causing one of A2\u2019s feet to come down on the sideline. B1 does not play the ball but instead pushes A2 with both hands on his waist. Had he not been pushed, A2 would have come down inbounds with both feet at the B30. Ruling: Third-and-10 on B45. Incomplete pass.  A.R. 8.24 COMPLETE PASS\u2014RECEIVER CARRIED OUT OF BOUNDS Second-and-10 on B45. A1 throws a pass to A2 near the sideline. A2 goes high to catch the pass, secures possession while in the air, and would have come down with both feet inbounds at the B30; however, B1 wraps him up while he is still in the air and carries A2 toward the sideline where he finally comes down out of bounds: (a) at the B28; or (b) at the B32. Rulings: (a) First-and-10 on B28 (or where the ball crossed the sideline). (b) First-and-10 on B30. When a receiver is carried out of bounds, rather than pushed out, the pass is complete, and the receiver gets his forward progress.

B1 secures control of the ball, but before his second foot touches the ground, A2 pushes him out of bounds at the A31. B1 never bobbles or loses control of the ball. Ruling: Second-and-5 on A30. Fumble forward out of bounds. The criteria for possession of a pass, or the recovery of a backward pass or fumble, are the same.  A.R. 8.26 SIMULTANEOUS CATCH\u2014BALL REMAINS ALIVE First-and-10 on A20. A2 and B3 simultaneously control a pass in the air at the A40.

Quarterback A1 scrambles to the A32 and throws a forward pass to end A2. B1 interferes with A2, but A2 catches the ball and runs for a touchdown. Ruling: Second-and-13 on A27. Illegal forward pass. No pass interference can occur on an illegal forward pass, unless it is a second forward pass from behind the line, or a pass thrown after the ball has crossed the line and comes back behind the line.  A.R. 8.32 ILLEGAL FORWARD PASS\u2014SECOND FORWARD PASS FROM A\u2019S END ZONE Second-and-12 on A10. Quarterback A1 has his pass batted back into his hands in the end zone. A1 then shovels the ball forward to back A2 who is tackled at the A9. Ruling: Safety. Safety kick A20. If the spot of an illegal forward pass is in Team A\u2019s end zone it will be a safety. Team B also has the option of declining the foul and taking the result of the play, 3-13-A9.  A.R. 8.33 ILLEGAL FORWARD PASS\u2014BATTED BY TEAM B PLAYER Third-and-5 on B11. Quarterback A1 hands off to back A2 who runs to the B5 where he attempts to lateral the ball to A3, but the ball goes forward to the B4-yard line where B2 bats the ball in the air into the end zone. B3 then falls on the ball. Ruling: Fourth-and-4 on B10. An illegal forward pass by A2 is incomplete when it hits the ground. Five yards and loss of down from the spot of the pass.

A1 picks up the ball there, sees end A3 at the A40, and throws him the ball. A3 catches the ball at the A40 and runs to the B25 where he is tackled. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A22. A\u2019s pass was illegal, but when Team A recovered the ball after Team B touched it beyond the line, a new series of downs started for Team A. It keeps the ball after enforcement. If Team A recovers the ball beyond the line after it is touched by Team B beyond the line, the ball would be dead.  A.R. 8.35 ILLEGAL FORWARD PASS\u2014COMPLETE\u2014FUMBLED Fourth-and-5 on A30.

The punt is partially blocked by B1. The ball rolls to the A32 where B2 tries to pick it up, but it gets away and rolls back to the A27. A1 picks up the ball there, sees end A2 at the A40, and throws him the ball. B1 interferes with A2 as he is reaching for the forward pass. B1 intercepts and runs for a touchdown. Ruling: Touchdown Team B. Kickoff B35. No foul by B1, as the pass was \u201cnot from scrimmage,\u201d since the LOS went away when B2 touched the kick beyond the line. Team B will decline the foul for A1\u2019s illegal forward pass for throwing a forward pass after a change of possession.    Note: Had the ball not been touched by Team B beyond the line, and simply rolled back behind it on its own, in addition to an illegal forward pass by A1, this would also be defensive pass interference by B1, because the line of scrimmage would still exist. The fouls would offset, and the down would be replayed.   A.R. 8.37 ILLEGAL FORWARD PASS FROM BEHIND THE LINE\u2014DEFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE Third-and-10 on A30. During a forward pass that was thrown after A1 had crossed the line and then returned behind it, B1 interferes with receiver A2 at the A45. The pass is complete to A2 who is tackled at the 50. Ruling: Third-and-10 on A30. Illegal forward pass and defensive pass interference fouls offset. Pass interference, roughing the passer, and intentional grounding rules apply on legal or illegal passes thrown from behind the line of scrimmage.

A3 is about to catch the pass when B4 interferes with A3. The pass falls incomplete. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, second-and-10 on A10.

On the last play of the first half, A1 throws a forward pass which B1 intercepts in the end zone and runs out to the B3. As he is being tackled, B1 throws a backward pass to B2. After catching the pass, B2, while running in the end zone, attempts a backward pass to B3 that goes forward and hits the ground. Ruling: Safety. Since the safety was the result of a foul, Team A has the option to extend the period for a safety kick from the B20.

B2 intercepts the ball and is tackled at the B40. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B25. Since A2 was illegally contacted out of bounds, he is an eligible receiver as soon as he re-establishes, and this is defensive pass interference. Decline the illegal contact penalty. A2 must make an immediate attempt to return inbounds in order to be eligible.  A.R. 8.43 ILLEGALLY CHUCKED OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014RE-ESTABLISHES\u2014FIRST TO TOUCH Third-and-5 on B40. End A2 is illegally chucked out of bounds at the B30, immediately re-establishes inbounds, catches a pass at the B25, and runs for a touchdown. Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. An eligible receiver forced out of bounds illegally can be the first to touch a pass, provided he makes an immediate attempt to return inbounds and is inbounds when he first touches the pass.

Back A2 pushes B2 out of the way at the B14, catches the ball, and runs it into the end zone. Ruling: Touchdown Team A. There is no foul for the unintentional touching of a forward pass. There can be no offensive pass interference behind the line of scrimmage or after the ball is touched.  A.R. 8.51 INELIGIBLE RECEIVER\u2014FAILS TO REPORT\u2014CATCHES PASS Third-and-1 on A18. Player number 74 comes into the game and lines up at tight end. He is late coming in and runs directly to his position at the end of the line, without reporting to the Referee. Quarterback A1 throws number 74 a pass, and he catches the ball at the A25 and runs to the 50-yard line where he fumbles and B1 recovers at that spot. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. Decline the penalties for illegal touching and illegal formation/substitution.  A.R. 8.52 ILLEGAL TOUCH\u2014ILLEGAL CONTACT Third-and-5 on 50. End A2 is illegally chucked out of bounds at the B40.

DEFENSIVE CHUCKS AND CUTS A.R. 8.53 LEGAL CUT\u2014RECEIVER IS NOT FLEXED Third-and-6 on 50. End A2 lines up one yard outside of his tackle. Quarterback A1 throws an incomplete pass to the B30. Prior to the pass, B1 blocked A2 below the waist at the line of scrimmage. Ruling: Fourth-and-6 on 50. No foul. A receiver who is not flexed, (lined up within two yards of his tackle), may be blocked below the waist on or behind the line within the tight end box (see 8-4-5-a, 12-2-4-d).  A.R. 8.54 LEGAL CUT\u2014CONTACT BEHIND LINE WHILE BALL IS IN THE AIR Third-and-9 on B30. Quarterback A1 is in a shotgun formation, and back A2 flanks four yards outside the tackle. A1 throws a screen pass to receiver A2 at the B32. As A2 reaches up to catch the ball, B4 blocks him below the waist, and the pass is incomplete. Ruling: Fourth-and-9 on B30. No foul unless the action by B4 is considered unnecessary roughness.  Note: Illegal cut rules only apply prior to a pass being thrown, and pass interference rules apply only beyond the line. Consequently, there is no foul. (8-4-5-b)  A.R. 8.55 ILLEGAL CUT\u2014RECEIVER IS FLEXED Second-and-10 on B35. Flanker A2 lines up three yards outside his tight end. At the snap, B2 blocks A2 below the waist at the line of scrimmage. Quarterback A1 completes a pass to his tight end at the B32 where he is downed. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B17. Personal foul (illegal cut) by B2, as A2 is flexed, (more than two yards outside his own tackle). This is also an illegal block below the waist because it occurs outside the tight end box (12-2-4-d). The penalty is enforced from the dead ball spot. (8-4-5)  A.R. 8.56 LEGAL CHUCK\u2014QB IS OUT OF THE POCKET First-and-10 on B40.

Personal foul (illegal cut) by B2, as A2 is flexed, (more than two yards outside his own tackle). This is also an illegal block below the waist because it occurs outside the tight end box (12-2-4-d). The penalty is enforced from the dead ball spot. (8-4-5)  A.R. 8.56 LEGAL CHUCK\u2014QB IS OUT OF THE POCKET First-and-10 on B40. Quarterback A1 rolls out of the pocket to the right and throws a forward pass to end A2, who was chucked by B2 at the B30 after A1 had moved to a position directly behind the original position of the tight end, and before he threw the pass. The pass falls incomplete. Ruling: Second-and-10 on B40. Illegal contact rules no longer apply once the ball leaves the pocket. (8-4-7)  A.R. 8.57  LEGAL/ILLEGAL CONTACT\u2014RECEIVER CONTACTED TWICE\u2014CONTACTED IN BACK Second-and-10 on B40. As quarterback A1 drops back in the pocket, B1 chucks wideout A2 at the B39. A2 cuts to the outside and gets away from B1, but he is then chucked again (clearly a separate act) at the B35 by (a) B1, or; (b) B2, (c) or in the back by B2. A1 is then sacked at the B45. Rulings: (a) First-and-10 on B35. The second chuck by the same player, even within five yards of the LOS, is illegal. (b) Third-and-15 on B45. The second chuck by a different player is legal.

A1 never leaves the pocket area and throws a pass to A2 at the B10 which falls incomplete. B2 chucked A2 at the B22 prior to the pass. Rulings: (a) Third-and-10 on B30.

On the last play of the game, Team A is behind by four points. Quarterback QB A1 takes the snap and pitches back to A2 (still in the original pocket area) who sets up to throw to end A3 who is in the end zone. After the pitch and prior to pass from A2, B1 chucks A3 deep in the end zone. The pass falls incomplete. Ruling: Game over. No foul. B1 can legally chuck downfield prior to the pass once the ball leaves the possession of the player who receives the snap. (8-4-7)  A.R. 8.60 LEGAL/ILLEGAL CHUCK\u2014PUNT/FIELD GOAL FORMATION Fourth-and-2 on B40. Team A lines up in (a) a punt formation; or (b) a field goal formation. A3 who is the widest receiver on the left side of the formation is chucked by B3 at the B33. A1 throws a pass which B2 intercepts and returns for a touchdown.  Rulings:  (a) Touchdown Team B. Kickoff B35. Actions that constitute illegal contact in a standard scrimmage formation are permitted when a team presents an apparent punt formation, though defensive holding is prohibited. (b) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B35. Illegal contact rules against eligible receivers remain in effect when Team A is in a field goal formation.   PASS INTERFERENCE A.R. 8.61 OFFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014BLOCKING BEYOND THE LINE BEFORE THE PASS IS TOUCHED  Second-and-10 on A30. Tight end A3 blocks the linebacker on the line of scrimmage, breaks contact, and then initiates new contact six yards downfield prior to the pass being thrown to wide receiver A4 at the A45. Ruling: Second-and-20 on A20. Offensive pass interference. If an offensive player blocks a defensive player more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage before a pass is touched, it is a foul for offensive pass interference.  A.R. 8.62 OFFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014INELIGIBLE BLOCKING DOWNFIELD Third-and-4 on A30. A1 throws a shovel pass to A2 who catches it at the A29 and runs to the A40. Prior to the pass, center A5 goes downfield and blocks linebacker B1 at the A33. Ruling: Third-and-14 on A20. Offensive pass interference. Decline the foul for ineligible downfield.   A.R. 8.63 OFFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014PLAYER INITIATES BLOCK WITHIN ONE YARD First-and-goal on B7. (a) Tight end, or (b) left tackle, A2 blocks B1 at the line of scrimmage and maintains his block without losing contact and drives B1 downfield to the goal line. The pass is thrown to A3 who cuts behind A2 at the goal line while A2 is still blocking in the end zone. A3 catches the ball for a touchdown. Rulings:  (a) First-and-goal on B17. Offensive pass interference. (b) Touchdown Team A, kickoff A35. This is legal, because A2 is an ineligible player who made contact within 1- yard of the line of scrimmage and maintained continuous contact from his initial contact.   A.R. 8.64 OFFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014PUSH OFF First-and-10 on A30. Wideout A3 extends his arms and pushes B5 (who is covering him) at the A33 to create space. He runs across the field and eventually catches a pass at the A37 on the other side of the field. He runs to the 50 where he is tackled inbounds.  Ruling: First-and-20 on A20. If an offensive player pushes off a defensive player to create space more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage before attempting to catch a pass, it is offensive pass interference.  A.R. 8.65 DEFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014ARM BAR First-and-10 on A30. A1 throws a forward pass to A2 at the 50.

As both players are looking for the ball, B2 uses his left arm to hold down A2\u2019s left arm so he cannot lift it to catch the pass, which falls incomplete. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. Defensive pass interference. It would be offensive pass interference if A2 was holding down B2\u2019s arm to prevent an interception.  A.R. 8.66 DEFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014CUT WITH BALL IN AIR  Second-and-10 on A30. B1 cuts end A2 below the waist at the B40 as A2 is reaching for the ball. The pass falls incomplete. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B40. This is defensive pass interference because the ball is in the air to that receiver, but it is not an illegal cut, because the ball is in the air.

Quarterback A1 throws a pass to A3 who is three yards deep in B\u2019s end zone. B1 commits pass interference in the end zone. Ruling: First-and-goal on B\u00be. Half the distance. When the ball is snapped from inside the B 2-yard line, if there is defensive pass interference in the end zone, the penalty is enforced half the distance to the goal.  A.R. 8.70 NOT PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014BOTH PLAYING BALL\u2014TANGLED FEET First-and-10 on A30. A1 throws a forward pass to A2 at the 50. Both A2 and B2 are looking back at the ball when their feet become entangled causing one or both to fall down. The pass is incomplete. Ruling: Second-and-10 on A30. Since both players were playing the ball, there is no foul for pass interference. If one is playing the ball and the other is not, it is pass interference on the player who is not playing the ball.   A.R. 8.71 NOT PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014NEITHER PLAYING BALL\u2014TANGLED FEET First-and-10 on A30. A1 throws a forward pass to A2 at the 50. Neither A2 or B2 are looking at the ball when their feet tangle. The pass is catchable. Ruling: Second-and-10 on A30. This is not a foul, as neither player is looking for, nor playing the ball. (8-5-3-b)  A.R. 8.72 NOT PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014BOTH PLAYING BALL First-and-10 on A30. A1 throws a forward pass to end A2 at the 50. Both A2 and B2 are looking back at the ball when they collide. They both had an equal opportunity to get to the ball. The pass falls incomplete. Ruling: Second-and-10 on A30. This is not a foul, as both players were playing the ball.   A.R. 8.73 NOT PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014NO TWIST OR TURN First-and-10 on A30. A1 throws a forward pass to A2 at the 50. As A2 reaches for the ball, B2 puts his right hand on or around A2\u2019s back but does not twist or turn him. The pass falls incomplete. Ruling: Second-and-10 on A30. This is not a foul. Putting a hand on or around A2\u2019s back is only a foul if A2 is pulled, twisted, or knocked off balance by B2 prior to either player touching the ball.  A.R. 8.74 NOT PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014PASS UNCATCHABLE Third-and-4 on 50. Eligible receiver A2 runs to the B40, and with the ball in the air, pushes off B2, before breaking to the sideline. The pass sails 10 yards over A2\u2019s head and lands in the stands. Ruling: Fourth-and-4 on 50. No penalty for pass interference, as the pass is uncatchable by the involved player. When determining whether a pass is catchable, the trajectory is taken into consideration. At the sideline, a pass must land outside the white to be considered uncatchable. If the pass is thrown with a low trajectory, it could still be catchable even if it lands outside the white.  A.R. 8.75 NOT PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014WIDEST MAN IN PUNT FORMATION  Fourth-and-10 on 50. Team A lines up in a punt formation, but instead of punting, A1 takes the snap and throws a pass to flyer A2 (the widest man in the formation on the left side).

A.R. 8.76 PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014PUNT FORMATION\u2014PUNT BLOCKED  Fourth-and-10 on 50. Team A lines up in a punt formation with A3 lined up as a flyer, (the widest man in the formation on the left side). A1\u2019s punt is blocked at the A40 and the ball bounces into A1\u2019s hands. A1 then immediately passes the ball to A3 at the B30. Just before the catchable pass reaches A3 at the B30, B1 pushes A3 out of the way and B1 intercepts the pass and is downed at the B40. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. Defensive pass interference rules are back in effect after the ball is punted, even for the player who was originally the widest man in the formation.  A.R. 8.77 NOT PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014PUNT FORMATION\u2014BALL NEVER KICKED  Fourth-and-10 on 50. Team A is in punt formation with A3 as a flyer, (the widest man in the formation on the left side). A1 muffs the snap and scrambles toward the sideline. Just before A1 gets to the sideline, he passes the ball to A3 at the B30. Before the catchable pass reaches A3 at the B30, B1 pushes A3 out of the way and B1 intercepts the pass and is downed at the B40. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B40. The exception to defensive pass interference rules, when Team A snaps the ball in an apparent punt formation, remains in effect until the ball is punted.  A.R. 8.78 HOLDING\u2014PUNT FORMATION Fourth-and-10 on 50. Team A lines up in a punt formation, but instead of punting, A1 takes the snap and throws a pass to flyer A2, (the widest man in the formation on the left side): (a) B1 holds A2 at the B40 before the pass; or (b) B1 holds A2 with the ball in the air clearly preventing his ability to catch the pass. A1\u2019s subsequent pass to A2 falls incomplete. Ruling: (a) and (b) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B45.

A1 drops back to the B48 while looking for an open receiver. He throws a pass to A2 who has gotten behind B1 at the B20. B1 turns his back to the passer, and at the B21, waves both his hands in A2\u2019s face. Because B1\u2019s hands are in front of A2\u2019s face, A2 loses sight of the ball and it falls incomplete. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B40. Not pass interference. There must be contact to have pass interference.  A.R. 8.80 NOT PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014CONTACT AFTER TIPPED PASS Second-and-10 on A35. A1 throws a forward pass which is tipped by defensive tackle B5 at the line of scrimmage. After the pass is tipped, receiver A2 is interfered with at the 50 and the pass falls incomplete. Ruling: Third-and-10 on A35. No foul. Pass interference restrictions end when a pass is touched. If the interference occurred before the pass was touched, it would be a foul. (8-5-1)  INELIGIBLE PLAYER DOWNFIELD A.R. 8.81 INELIGIBLE PLAYER DOWNFIELD\u2014OFFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE Second-and-5 on A30. Tackle A6 blocks B4 legally and drives him downfield to the A35 and then loses contact. A6 then moves laterally and: (a) blocks B2; or (b) does not block. The forward pass is then thrown incomplete to A2 at the 50. Rulings: (a) Second-and-15 on A20, or third-and-5 on A30. Offensive pass interference. (b) Third-and-5 on A30. No foul for ineligible downfield. Because A6 is legal in blocking his man downfield, after losing contact, A6 may legally move laterally or back towards his own end line. However, it is offensive pass interference if, after losing contact with B4, A6 blocks anyone more than one yard beyond the line before the pass is touched.  A.R. 8.82 INELIGIBLE PLAYER DOWNFIELD\u2014PASS DEFLECTS OFF HIM Second-and-5 on A30. Tackle A6 goes downfield prior to the pass being thrown, and the forward pass hits him at the A35 and falls incomplete. Ruling: Second-and-10 on A25, or third-and-5 on A30. The foul is for an ineligible receiver downfield, not illegal touching (unless A6 intentionally touches the pass).  A.R. 8.83 INELIGIBLE PLAYER DOWNFIELD AFTER LOSING CONTACT WITH DEFENDER Second-and-13-B35. Tackle A6 immediately blocks B3 on the line of scrimmage and drives him downfield for 4 yards. A6 then loses contact with B3 and (a) retreats to the line of scrimmage or (b) moves laterally on the B39 yard line. A1 completes a pass to the B20.  Rulings: (a) and (b) A 1-10-B20. If an ineligible player makes contact with a defender within one yard of his line of scrimmage and drives him downfield, when contact is lost, the ineligible can move laterally or retreat; it is illegal, though, if he moves further downfield after losing contact.   A.R. 8.84 INELIGIBLE LINEMAN DOWNFIELD \u2013 MORE OR LESS THAN ONE YARD Second-and-five at A25. Tackle A6 initially retreats to block, then advances forward. QBA1 throws the ball to end A2 at the A30. A2 catches the ball and is tackled at the A35. During the pass, A6 is at: (a) the A26\u00bd with his back foot at the A26; or (b) the A27\u00bd with his back foot at the A27.  Rulings:  (a)  First-and-10 at A35. No foul for Ineligible Downfield. (b)  Second-and-10 at A20. Five-yard penalty for Ineligible Downfield because the entire body of A6 was more than a yard beyond the line of scrimmage when the pass was thrown.

Thirty seconds remain in the game, and Team A is behind in the score and out of timeouts. Quarterback A1 drops back looking for receivers and then, after delaying, throws the ball down directly in front of him at the A34 with no defenders near him. Ruling: Third-and-18 on A32. Intentional grounding. Ten-second runoff, (if the defense elects). Start the game clock on the ready-for-play signal. The score is irrelevant. Even though the QB was not under pressure, he cannot throw the ball directly into the ground, unless he receives the snap in a T-QB position and immediately spikes it to stop the clock.   A.R. 8.89 INTENTIONAL GROUNDING\u2014MUFFED SNAP\u2014BALL DOES/DOES NOT HIT GROUND First-and-10 on B20. One minute and thirty-five seconds remain in the first half, and Team A is hurrying to score before halftime. T-QB A1 muffs the snap, and: (a) regains possession of the ball before it hits the ground; or (b) the ball hits the ground but bounces back into A1\u2019s hands. A1 then immediately spikes the ball to stop the clock. Rulings: (a) Second-and-10 on B20. No foul since the ball did not hit the ground, and the QB spiked the ball as soon as he gained possession.  (b) Second-and-20 on B30 and run 10 seconds off the clock if Team B chooses. This is intentional grounding. If Team A has timeouts remaining, it can use one in lieu of the 10-second runoff, but the yardage and loss of down will still be enforced.  A.R. 8.90 INTENTIONAL GROUNDING\u2014SPIKE TO CONSUME TIME First-and-10 on B30. The game clock is stopped with six seconds left in the first half. QBA1 takes the snap and immediately spikes the ball into the ground to take one second off the clock so that a field-goal attempt will run out the clock. Ruling: Half over. Intentional grounding and a 10-second runoff. A QB can only spike the ball to stop a running game clock. An attempt to take time off the clock is intentional grounding.   A.R. 8.91 NOT INTENTIONAL GROUNDING\u2014NOT UNDER PRESSURE Third-and-3 on B40. Quarterback A1 drops straight back and, without any defenders near him, throws the ball downfield to an open area at the B35. The pass falls incomplete with no receivers in proximity. Ruling: Fourth-and-3 on B40. Not intentional grounding, as the quarterback is not under pressure.   A.R. 8.92 NOT INTENTIONAL GROUNDING\u2014QB TAKES STEP BACK BEFORE SPIKING BALL Second-and-10 on A1. T-QB A1 takes a quick step back into the end zone and immediately throws the ball down in front of him to stop the clock with 35 seconds remaining in the game. He is not under pressure.  Ruling: Third-and-10 on A1. Not intentional grounding. If the QB takes more than one quick step backward, it is a foul for intentional grounding.   A.R. 8.93 NOT INTENTIONAL GROUNDING\u2014BALL OUT OF POCKET Second-and-5 on A35. A1 hands the ball to A2 who runs outside the tackle and then pitches the ball back to A1 who is still in the pocket. A1, under severe pressure, then throws the ball out of bounds beyond the line of scrimmage with no receiver in the area. Ruling: Third-and-5 on A35.

With 1:52 left in the game, A1 throws a backward pass from the B25 to back A2 who muffs the ball forward where it rolls out of bounds at the B14 (1:45). Ruling: A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-10 on B25. This is a muffed backward pass that goes out of bounds and not a fumble. Because the backward pass went out of bounds after the two-minute warning, this is an illegal action to conserve time. Run 10 seconds (1:35) and wind the clock. Team B can accept the penalty yardage and decline the runoff. If the runoff is declined, or Team A uses a timeout to avoid the runoff, the clock will start on the snap.  A.R. 8.107 BACKWARD PASS ON FOURTH DOWN\u2014RECOVERED BEYOND LINE BY TEAM A  Fourth-and-goal on B5. Team A trails 17-13 on the last play of the game. QB A1 takes the snap and tosses a backward pass to back A3 who muffs the pass at the B10. The ball is muffed by several players until it rolls into the end zone and A5 recovers. Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Legal recovery by A5 because the status of the ball is a backward pass, not a fumble. Team A wins 19-17. The Try is not attempted.  A.R. 8.108 BACKWARD PASS\u2014BATTED IN FLIGHT BY DEFENSE First-and-10 on 50. Quarterback A1 pitches the ball backward, and it is batted (in flight) on the A45 by B6 to the A40 where B5 recovers the ball and runs for a touchdown. Ruling: Touchdown Team B. Kickoff B35. A pass in flight (forward or backward) may be batted in any direction by any defensive player. (3-22-5-Note)   A.R. 8.109 MUFFED SNAP ON KICK TRY During a Try from the B15, holder A2 muffs the snap. A3 picks up the ball and completes a pass from the B18 to end A4 in the end zone. Ruling: Try good. Award two points. Kickoff A35.  A.R. 8.110 MUFFED BACKWARD PASS\u2014LEGAL PUSH IN BACK TO RECOVER Second-and-4 on B40. A2 passes backward to A3 at the B44, who muffs the ball. B1 attempts to recover the ball, but A3 pushes him in the back, recovers the ball at the B42, and runs to the B30. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. Legal action by A3, as the push in the back occurred during a personal attempt to recover a loose ball.  A.R. 8.111 BACKWARD PASS\u2014DEFENSIVE HOLDING WHILE PASS IS IN THE AIR Second-and-15 on A3. A1 flips a backward pass to A2 who is in the end zone. Before A2 can catch the ball, B2 tackles him, and the ball goes out of bounds in the end zone. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A8. The foul (holding) by B2 is enforced from the previous spot. If B2 had been making a personal attempt to recover the ball, the action would only be legal had the ball already hit the ground (12-1-5(c)).  FUMBLES A.R. 8.112 FUMBLE FORWARD\u2014TOUCHED BY OUT OF BOUNDS PLAYER Third-and-8 on B34. A2 fumbles near the sideline at the B28. B2, who was out of bounds, steps inbounds and recovers the fumble at the B25 with one foot touching the sideline. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-2 on B28. For a legal recovery, the player must have re-established with both feet (or body part other than hands) inbounds prior to the recovery. Fumble forward out of bounds.

A2 fumbles near the sideline at the B28. B2, who was out of bounds, steps inbounds and recovers the fumble at the B25 with one foot touching the sideline. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-2 on B28. For a legal recovery, the player must have re-established with both feet (or body part other than hands) inbounds prior to the recovery. Fumble forward out of bounds. The game clock should be restarted by the Referee as the ball is being brought back into the field, before it is actually spotted at the hash mark. If time is an issue, the Referee should tell the QB that the clock will be starting.  A.R. 8.113 FUMBLE FORWARD\u2014OUT OF BOUNDS Third-and-6 on A40. Back A2 runs to the 50 and fumbles the ball to the B48 where B3 and A3 recover the ball simultaneously. B3\u2019s right foot is touching the sideline when the ball is recovered.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. A simultaneous recovery would belong to the fumbling team, but since B3 is out of bounds and touching a loose ball, this is a fumble forward out of bounds and not a simultaneous recovery.

On the last play of the game with the score tied, end A2 catches a forward pass at the B10 and runs to the B1-yard line, is tackled, but before he is down the ball pops out of A2\u2019s hands into the air. A3 catches the ball in the end zone. Ruling: Go to overtime. Only A2 can recover and advance the ball.  A.R. 8.117 TEAM B FUMBLE\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING First-and-10 on B20. After the two-minute warning, A1 fumbles on the B18. B1 picks up the ball there and goes to the B20 where he fumbles. B2 recovers there and runs to the B30. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. The ball is dead when recovered by B2, and the clock should be stopped. B1 fumbled and is the only Team B player who can recover and advance in the last two minutes. Two-minute fumble rules are also applicable during a Try.   A.R. 8.118 FUMBLE/MUFFED HANDOFF\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING  First-and-10 on A20. After the two-minute warning, A1 attempts to hand the ball to A2 at the A18. A2 does not get the ball cleanly and bobbles the ball until he gets to the A21, at which point: (a) he gains full control of the ball without it ever hitting the ground; or (b) before getting control of the ball, it hits the ground once at the A21 and bounces right back up into A2\u2019s hands and he gains complete control. A2 runs to the 50 where he is run out of bounds. Rulings: (a) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. This is transferring player possession and not a fumble if either player immediately regains control of the ball before it hits the ground, so A2 can advance once he gains control. (b) A\u2019s ball, second-and-12 on A18. Since neither player immediately regained control before the ball hit the ground, this is considered a fumble by A1 on the exchange, and therefore the ball returns to the A18, which is the spot of the fumble by the fumbling player (A1).  A.R. 8.119 FUMBLE BY TEAM B AFTER INTERCEPTION\u2014BEFORE/AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Second-and-7 on B15. B1 intercepts a pass in the end zone, runs, and fumbles the ball in the end zone. The ball rolls out to the B3 where B2 recovers: (a) prior to the two-minute warning; or (b) after the two-minute warning. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B3. Before the two-minute warning, only Team A is restricted from advancing a fourth-down fumble, and there are no restrictions for Team B.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. Two-minute fumble rules apply to both teams, throughout the down.  FOUL DURING FUMBLE A.R. 8.120 TEAM B FOUL DURING FUMBLE BEYOND LINE Second-and-12 on A40. A2 runs to the B45, fumbles, and B5 recovers. B3 committed a personal foul at the 50 during the fumble. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. When a foul occurs during a fumble, the basic spot of enforcement is the spot of the fumble.  A.R. 8.121 TEAM B FOUL DURING FUMBLE BEHIND LINE Second-and-12 on A40. A2 fumbles at the A35. B6 holds A2 to allow B5 to recover the fumble at the A35. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A45. When the fumble is behind the line of scrimmage, the enforcement spot for a foul during a fumble is the previous spot.  A.R. 8.122 TEAM A FOUL DURING FUMBLE Third-and-6 on A44.

This is an illegal forward handoff resulting in a fumble, so Team A would decline the foul and keep the ball.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B5. Illegal forward handing is enforced from where the player was when he handed the ball forward.  A.R. 8.126 MUFFED FORWARD HANDOFF BEYOND LINE Third-and-10 on B40. A1 scrambles, and when he is at the B39, attempts to hand the ball to A2 who is at the B38. A2 muffs the handoff, and the ball rolls to the B35 where B1 attempts to pick it up but accidentally kicks the ball, and it continues to roll to the B12 where B1 finally falls on it. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B12 (decline the forward handing foul), or A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-14 on B44.  A.R. 8.127 BATTING OF FORWARD PASS BY TEAM A PLAYER TO TEAMMATE First-and-10 on A25. A1 throws a forward pass to A2 who, at the A40, bats the ball forward to eligible A3 at the A45, who catches the ball and runs for a touchdown. Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. Legal play. A forward pass in flight may be batted in any direction by any eligible player.  A.R. 8.128 CONTROLLED BAT OF PASS BY TEAM A\u2014FORWARD/BACKWARD Third-and-10 on A40. Receiver A2 jumps in the air and controls the forward pass while still airborne at the B30. Before coming to the ground, A2 throws the ball: (a) forward; or (b) backward, to A3 who catches the ball and scores. Rulings: (a) Fourth-and-20 on A30. The illegal bat is enforced from the previous spot with a loss of down. This is also a foul if the pass is incomplete or intercepted. A forward pass that is controlled by a player and thrown forward (before completing the catch), is an illegal bat. While a forward pass in flight may be batted in any direction by any eligible player, a controlled forward bat is illegal.  (b) Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. This is a legal bat toward Team A\u2019s end line.  A.R. 8.129 BATTED PASS BY TEAM A CAUGHT BY INELIGIBLE First-and-10 on A25. A1 passes forward to A2 who, at the A30, bats the ball forward to tackle A6 who was legally downfield. A6 catches the ball and runs for a touchdown. Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. Legal play. The touch by A2 makes A6 eligible to catch the pass.   A.R. 8.130 FORWARD HANDING BEHIND LINE\u2014PASS TO SHOTGUN QB Second-and-10 on A20. Quarterback A1, in a shotgun formation, hands off forward to back A2, who runs right on a sweep, stops, and passes from the A18 to A1 at the A26 who catches the pass and is tackled at the A31. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A31. Since A1 was not under center, he is an eligible receiver and the handoff forward to an eligible receiver behind the line is legal and not considered a forward pass.  A.R. 8.131 NO GRASP-AND-CONTROL\u2014PLAY REMAINS ALIVE  Third-and-2 on A27. Quarterback A1 scrambles to the A24 and is grabbed by B1 below the waist. No other Team B players are in the vicinity. B1 attempts to tackle A1, but before he hits the ground A1 throws a pass to A3 who catches the ball on the A45 and scores. Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35.

Quarterback A1 is grabbed at the waist and controlled by B1 at the A20. B2 and B3 also are about to tackle A1. Prior to hitting the ground, A1 is able to throw the ball to A2 at the A48 who then scores. Ruling: Third-and-10 on A20.

A2 drives B1 into the field of play (either while B1 is airborne or on his feet), causing B1 to fall to his knee on the B1 with the ball at the B2. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B2. Since A2 drove B1 forward, there is no forward progress, and the dead ball spot is where the ball is when B1 was down.  A.R. 8.134 NO PASS INTERFERENCE\u2014ELIGIBILITY LOST Third-and-10 on A40.

The Referee should kill the play immediately when the QB fakes taking a knee.   A.R. 8.136 QUARTERBACK MUFFS SNAP\u2014ATTEMPTS TO SPIKE/SPIKES BALL Third-and-10 on B25. Quarterback A1, who wants to spike the ball to kill the clock, muffs the snap, and: (a) pushes the ball to the ground in an attempt to spike it, and B3 falls on the ball at the B30; (b) regains possession of the ball before it hits the ground, and immediately spikes the ball which glances off A2\u2019s foot and hits the ground; or (c) regains possession of the ball before it hits the ground, and immediately spikes the ball which glances off A2\u2019s foot and bounces up (without hitting the ground) and is intercepted by B3 at the B30 where he is tackled. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. This is a muffed backward pass and a legal recovery by Team B. (b) Fourth-and-10 on B25. Incomplete pass. There is no foul for intentional grounding or illegal touching.  (c) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. Interception since the ball never touched the ground. There is no foul for illegal touching.

Team A lines up in a standard punt formation, with B1 on the line of scrimmage and directly over snapper A2. The ball is snapped to punter A1. (a) A1 muffs the snap, picks up the ball and runs to the A23 where he is downed; or (b) A1 shanks the punt out of bounds at the 50.  Rulings: (a) and (b) Fourth-and-5 on A25. Illegal formation. The foul happens at the snap, due to the standard punt formation, and the ball does not need to be kicked. See 9-1-3, Item 1.  A.R. 9.2 DEFENSIVE ALIGNMENT OVER CENTER\u2014FIELD GOAL OR TRY ATTEMPT  Fourth-and 5 on B25. Team A lines up in a standard field-goal formation with B1 in a two-point stance directly over snapper A2. Before the snap, he takes a step back so that he is more than a yard off the line of scrimmage, but his feet are still even with the back foot of B3, who is in a three-point stance on the line of scrimmage. The kick is good. Ruling: Team A is awarded 3 points, KO A35. The defensive formation is legal, because the defender over the center is more than a yard off the line of scrimmage at the snap. See 9-1-3, Item 2.  A.R. 9.3 DEFENSIVE ALIGNMENT\u2014FIELD GOAL Fourth-and-10 on B25. A1\u2019s field-goal attempt from the B33 is wide right. At the snap Team B: (a) had seven men on the line of scrimmage to the left of the snapper, but only six rushed; or (b) had six men on the line of scrimmage to the left of the snapper. In both (a) and (b), Team A was lined up in a standard field-goal formation. Rulings: (a) A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-5 on B20. Illegal formation. Team B cannot have more than six players on the line on either side of the snapper at the snap when Team A presents a standard field goal formation, regardless of how many players rush the kicker.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B33. No foul.  A.R. 9.4 DEFENSIVE ALIGNMENT\u2014MOTION OR SHIFT Fourth-and-5 on A25. Team A initially lines up in a standard punt formation and all 11 players come set. After setting up 7 yards deep, personal protector A2 steps 3 yards forward to call signals, and then returns to a position 7 yards deep before the ball is snapped.

(b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B33. No foul.  A.R. 9.4 DEFENSIVE ALIGNMENT\u2014MOTION OR SHIFT Fourth-and-5 on A25. Team A initially lines up in a standard punt formation and all 11 players come set. After setting up 7 yards deep, personal protector A2 steps 3 yards forward to call signals, and then returns to a position 7 yards deep before the ball is snapped. B1 is lined up on the line of scrimmage directly over center A3. Punter A1 shanks the punt out of bounds at the A45. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A45. On scrimmage kicks, motion or a shift by Team A removes the prohibition on Team B against covering the center. It is a shift, if the personal protector moves both feet, after all 11 offensive players have come set for a full second.    A.R. 9.5 DEFENSIVE ALIGNMENT\u2014UNBALANCED FIELD-GOAL FORMATION Fourth-and-5 on B25. Team A lines up in an unbalanced field-goal formation with 2 tackles on the right side. B3 is originally lined up over guard A6, but just before the snap he slides over and covers up the snapper. The kick from the B33 is wide left.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B33. If Team A does not present a standard field goal formation (an equal number of players on either side of the snapper, in a tight formation), it removes the restrictions on Team B relating to covering the center.  A.R. 9.6 DEFENSE PUSHING TEAMMATES\u2014PUNT/FIELD GOAL/TRY FORMATION Fourth-and-10 on B32. (a) A1\u2019s field-goal attempt from the B40 is missed; or (b) A1\u2019s punt goes out of bounds at the B15. At the snap, B1 and B2, who are both in two-point stances, push linemen B4 and B8 into the offensive formation. Rulings: (a) and (b) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B17. Unnecessary roughness. Team B players cannot push teammates into the offensive formation when Team A is lined up for a punt, field goal, or kick-Try attempt. The enforcement is from the previous spot and an automatic first down. This is a foul because of the kick formation, and the ball does not have to be kicked.  A.R. 9.7 OFFENSIVE HOLDING\u2014PUNT Fourth-and-5 on A45. At the snap, B2 rushes Punter A1 and is pulled down by personal protector A3: (a) just before the ball is kicked; or (b) just after the ball has been kicked and is beyond B2.

The ball rolls to the B10, where B1 picks it up, runs to the 50, fumbles, and A3 recovers there. (a) During B1\u2019s run, B2 clipped on the B40, or (b) B2 held on the B35.  Rulings:  (a) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B35. The personal foul by B2 can be carried over the fumble and enforced from the dead ball spot, (personal foul prior to an interception, or prior to the recovery of a fumble or backward pass). The enforcement of that foul eliminates the spot of first touching.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B14.

The punt lands at the B10 where, (a) A2 intentionally bats the ball backward into receiver B1, or (b) A2 kicks the ball into receiver B1. A3 then recovers at the B12.

The post possession foul for holding or blocking in the back would be enforced from where the kick ended at the B12. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B6, or fourth-and-10 on B40. This is a double foul with a change of possession. B1 is deemed not to have touched the ball, because it was kicked into him, so it is Team B\u2019s ball at the end of the down.

A1\u2019s punt is rolling, (a) at the B6, where A2 recovers and downs it; or (b) at the B4, where A2 recovers and downs it; or (c) at the B4, where it is recovered by A2 and carried into the end zone. A2 had been legally blocked out of bounds at the B40 but returned immediately inbounds. Rulings: (a) Fourth-and-15 on A45, or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B11. The illegal touching can be enforced from the previous spot or the dead ball spot. (b) Fourth-and-15 on A45, or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. The illegal touching inside the five-yard line by a player who had been out of bounds gives Team B the additional option of a touchback. (c) Fourth-and-15 on A45, or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B25. The result of the play is a touchback, so the five-yard penalty can be tacked on from the B20.   A.R. 9.31 FIRST TOUCH\u2014PLAYER FROM OUT OF BOUNDS Fourth-and-10 on 50. A1 punts the ball deep to B3 at the 10-yard line. B3 lets the ball go, and flyer A2 bats the ball at the B1 back to the B5. As the ball is rolling at the B5, A3 who had been legally blocked out of bounds, comes in and re-establishes himself, and then falls on the ball at the B5. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B5. Team B takes the ball at the most advantageous spot of first touching. The touch by A3, while a first touch, is not a foul, because the ball has previously been touched by another player (A or B on scrimmage kick plays).  A.R. 9.32 MULTIPLE ILLEGAL TOUCH SPOTS\u2014PLAYER FROM OUT OF BOUNDS Fourth-and-10 on 50. Gunner A2 is legally blocked out of bounds as he covers the punt, but A2 re-establishes inbounds and is then the first to touch the rolling punt at the B16. The punt continues to roll toward the goal line untouched by anyone else, until A2 downs the ball on the B4. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20, or fourth-and-15 on A45. Multiple fouls by A2. Team B can take the ball at the spot of the first illegal touch (B16), enforce the five-yard penalty from the dead-ball spot (also the spot of A2\u2019s second touching), enforce the five-yard penalty at the previous spot and replay the down, or take a touchback due to the touching inside the 5-yard line. There is no option to enforce the five-yard penalty from the first illegal touch spot (B16), because that was not the dead-ball spot.  A.R. 9.33 FIRST TOUCH\u2014POSSESSION BY TEAM A\u2014RELEASES BALL Fourth-and-8 on B48. The punted ball comes down at the B4-yard line, where A2 catches it and his momentum carries him into the end zone; however, he releases the ball at the B1-yard line, but the ball rolls into the end zone. No Team B player could have caught the ball. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B4. The play becomes dead as soon as A2 releases the ball in his possession. Because he releases it prior to touching in the end zone with possession, Team B will next snap at the spot A2 first touches the ball, which is also the dead ball spot in this case. It is irrelevant where the ball lands after he releases the ball.  A.R. 9.34 FIRST TOUCH\u2014NO POSSESSION BY TEAM A Fourth-and-8 on B48. A1 punts the ball high in the air.

Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. A punted ball is dead when the kickers catch or recover a kick beyond the line of scrimmage (9-3-2). If a kicking team player loses control before completing possession (3-2-7), the ball remains loose.  A.R. 9.35 MULTIPLE FIRST TOUCH SPOTS\u2014POSSESSION BY TEAM A\u2014RELEASES BALL Fourth-and-8 on B48. The punted ball is bouncing at the B8-yard line, where A2 tries to recover it in full stride, but muffs it toward the goal line. He then possesses it at the B4-yard line and his momentum carries him into the end zone; however, he releases the ball at the B1-yard line, and the ball rolls into the end zone. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B8. The play becomes dead as soon as A2 releases the ball in his possession. Because he releases it prior to touching in the end zone with possession, the dead ball spot is where A2 first possesses it, the B4. Team B will take the ball at the spot A2 first touches the ball, the B8.  A.R. 9.36 FIRST TOUCH\u2014TEAM A PLAYER KEEPS TEAMMATE OUT OF END ZONE Fourth-and-4 on 50. A1 punts the ball and A2 and A3 run downfield to cover it before it goes into the end zone. A2 recovers the ball at the B4, and his momentum takes him toward the goal line. A3, while his foot is in the end zone, grabs his teammate A2 and prevents him from going into the end zone or touching the goal line. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B4.

A1 first touches and recovers the punt on the B4 and carries it into the end zone. Before A1 reaches the goal line: (a) A2 clips on B6; or (b) B1 clips on B6.             Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B35. The clip is enforced from the succeeding spot, which is the B20.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B3. Spot of the clip is inside B\u2019s 20-yard line so the penalty is enforced from the spot of the foul.  IMPETUS A.R. 9.39 IMPETUS\u2014TEAM A BLOCKS TEAM B INTO BALL Fourth-and-10 on 50. The punted ball rolls to the B6. B1 steps aside and makes no attempt to field the ball. A2 blocks passive B1 into the ball, and the ball: (a) rolls over the end line; or (b) rolls to the B3 where A4 recovers. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. Touchback. The impetus is attributed to the block by A2. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B3. A passive player blocked into a loose ball is deemed not to have touched it.  Note: If the punt is nearly at rest, and no Team B player is attempting to recover it, the Back Judge should blow it dead. If the ball is still alive, though, and a player blocks a passive opponent into the ball, sending the ball into the end zone, the impetus changes from the kick, fumble, or backward pass, and the new impetus is attributed to the blocking player. Furthermore, the touching by the passive opponent who was blocked into the ball is ignored.   A.R. 9.40 TEAM A IMPETUS\u2014B BATS KICK IN END ZONE Fourth-and-5 on B45. A\u2019s punt is muffed at the B8 by B1 (no new impetus). The punt goes into B\u2019s end zone, where there is a scramble for the ball. B2 bats the ball in the end zone backward over the end line. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B10. Illegal bat, but since A\u2019s impetus put the ball in the end zone, and Team B did not run with the ball, enforcement is from B\u2019s 20-yard line. This is a post-possession foul, and the end of the kick is the touchback spot.   POST-POSSESSION A.R. 9.41 POST-POSSESSION FOUL IN TEAM B END ZONE\u2014NO RETURN Fourth-and-3 on A45. A1\u2019s punt is muffed by B1 at the B5 yard line, and as the ball continues to roll toward the sideline, B2 grabs A2 in the end zone, to prevent A2 from recovering the loose ball. (B2 is not making a personal attempt to recover.) The ball rolls out of bounds at the B2. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B1. Since Team B fouled in their end zone but did not run with the ball, the spot of the foul is deemed to be the B20. Therefore, this post-possession foul is enforced from the end of the kick, (the B2), as that is the least advantageous spot for Team B.    A.R. 9.42 POST-POSSESSION\u2014TEAM B FOUL IN FIELD OF PLAY\u2014TOUCHBACK Fourth-and-8 on A40. A1 punts. During the punt, B2 blocks low at the B8. The punted ball goes over the end line. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B4. Since there was no return, it is considered a touchback, and the penalty is enforced from the spot of B\u2019s foul if that spot is inside the 20-yard line.

During the punt, B2 clips in the end zone. Ruling: Safety. Safety kick B20. Post-possession foul with a return. Because Team B ran with the ball and the foul occurred in the end zone, the enforcement is a safety.

Since Team B does not have possession of the ball at the end of the down, this is not a post-possession foul.

Since Team B lost possession at some point after the kick, this is not a post-possession foul.

A.R. 9.47 NOT POST-POSSESSION\u2014TEAM B LOSES POSSESSION Fourth-and-10 on B45. While the punt is in the air, B2 pulls A2 down by the facemask at the B20. B1 fields the punt at the B10, but he fumbles at the B26 where the ball is recovered by A3. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B13. This is not a post-possession foul, and the opponent has possession at the end of the down, so the FMM can be enforced from the dead-ball spot.  A.R. 9.48 NOT POST-POSSESSION\u2014TEAM B LOSES POSSESSION AFTER THE KICK Fourth-and-12 on A38. During the punt, B1 holds A1 at the B45. B2 fields the punt at the B10 and returns it to the B15 where he fumbles. A2 scoops up the ball there and runs to the B5 where he fumbles. B2 recovers and is ultimately tackled at the B45. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-2 on A48. This is not a post-possession foul, as Team B lost possession at one point during the down. The ball is returned to Team A, and the holding foul is a 10-yard penalty (with no automatic first down) because it occurred during a kick that went beyond the line (9-1-4(d)).  SCRIMMAGE KICK CROSSES LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND RETURNS BEHIND LINE A.R. 9.49 PUNT OVER AND BACK\u2014TOUCHED BY TEAM B\u2014RECOVERED BY TEAM A Fourth-and-12 on A20. B1 partially blocks the punt and the ball bounces to the A22 where B2 attempts to recover but muffs the ball to the A18 where A2 picks up the ball, runs, and is tackled at the A25. Rulings: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A25. Team B touched the ball beyond the line of scrimmage.  A.R. 9.50 PUNT OVER AND BACK\u2014SIMULTANEOUS RECOVERY Fourth-and-5 on 50. B1 partially blocks the punt. The ball rolls to the B48 where it hits B2\u2019s leg and rolls back to the A48 where A1 and B1 fall on it. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A48. The simultaneous recovery of a legal kick by eligible opposing players belongs to the receivers.  A.R. 9.51 PUNT OVER AND BACK\u2014UNTOUCHED BEYOND LINE Fourth-and-10 on A25. A1\u2019s punt is partially blocked, hits on the A28, and then bounces back to the A22, untouched beyond the line. A2 recovers at the A22 and he: (a) is downed there; (b) runs with the ball to the A33; (c) runs with the ball to the A36; or (d) throws a pass from the A22, which is complete to A3 at the 50. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A22. If Team A recovers and does not advance, Team B gets the ball at the spot of recovery.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A33. If Team A recovers and advances, but does not reach the line to gain, Team B gets the ball at the dead ball spot.  (c) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A36.

Note: Team B does not have the option to take the ball at the spot of the kick if: (1) B touches the ball beyond the line of scrimmage; (2) the kick ends behind the line; or (3) a Team B foul during the play is accepted.  FAIR CATCH SIGNAL\u2014INTERFERENCE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY\u2014FAIR-CATCH KICK A.R. 9.55 FAIR CATCH\u2014EXTEND PERIOD FOR FAIR-CATCH KICK/SNAP Fourth-and-10 on A6. The score is 28-26 in favor of Team A. On the last play of the game, a partially blocked punt goes to the A28 where B1 gives a valid fair-catch signal. No time remains on the clock. (a) B1 catches it on the A28; (b) A4 interferes on the A28, and the ball is then caught by B1; or (c) B1 muffs the ball on the A28 and it rolls out of bounds on A30. Rulings: (a) The only option is a fair-catch kick on A28. Extend period. (b) Fair-catch kick or snap at the A14. Fair-catch interference. Extend period. (c) Game over. The fair catch was not completed.  A.R. 9.56 NO FAIR CATCH\u2014NO EXTENSION Fourth-and-5 on A10. There are four seconds remaining in the game, and the score is tied. B1 gives a valid fair-catch signal at the A35. The wind carries the ball to B2 who did not signal. B2 catches the ball on the A30 as time runs out. Ruling: Go to overtime. The ball is dead when caught by B2, and there is no extension.  A.R. 9.57 FAIR-CATCH INTERFERENCE\u2014OPTION TO EXTEND PERIOD Fourth-and-10 on A12. On the last play of the half, B1 signals for a fair catch at the 50. A1 tackles B1 before the ball arrives. The ball hits A1 in the back and rebounds to the A28 where: (a) B2 recovers; or (b) A2 recovers. Rulings: In both (a) and (b), Fair Catch Interference. Team B has the option of enforcing the FCI from the dead-ball spot (A28) and extending the period with a snap from the A14 (see 14-2-4), or enforcing the FCI from the spot of the awarded fair catch (50) and extending the period with a fair-catch kick from the A35 (snap would also be an option from the A35, but Team B would never choose that option)  A.R. 9.58 INTERFERENCE WITH OPPORTUNITY\u2014NO SIGNAL Fourth-and-7 on A11.

As A2 is running downfield after a punt, he pushes B2 in the back at the B40, as B2 is running downfield. The block happens: (a) while the kick is still in flight; (b) while the ball is rolling on the ground at the B10; or (c) after B3 has picked up the punt and is running with the ball at the B20. B3 is tackled at the B30. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B40 (or re-kick from A40). This foul can be tacked on to the end of the return, or it can be enforced at the previous spot.

The blocked punt never crosses the line of scrimmage, and it is picked back up by the punter and punted again. Prior to the second punt, several Team A players had gone downfield and are downfield at the time of the second punt. The punted ball goes out of bounds untouched at the B10.

Back A2 goes in motion and is outside his tight end A3 by two yards when the ball is snapped. A3 goes downfield at the snap before the ball is kicked. B1 catches the punt at the B40, runs to the A10, is tackled, fumbles, and A4 recovers there. Ruling: Fourth-and-10 on A25. A3 is not eligible to go downfield before the ball is kicked. There is no option to enforce the foul from the dead-ball spot, because Team B lost the ball. (9-1-2)   A.R. 9.63 TEAM A FOULS AT SNAP\u2014ENFORCEMENT OPTIONS Fourth-and-10 on A40. At the snap, tackle A3 is not on the line of scrimmage. B2 returns the punt to the B20. Ruling: Fourth-and-15 on A35, or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B25. Team B has the option to enforce from the previous spot or the succeeding spot.  Note: All fouls by Team A prior to the receiving team securing possession include the option to enforce from the previous spot or the dead-ball spot, provided that the receiving team does not lose possession.  A.R. 9.64 TEAM A OR B FOUL DURING PUNT Fourth-and-10 on B40. While the punt is in the air, (a) at the B36, A2 grabs B2, who was attempting to block him, pulls him aside, and continues downfield to cover the punt; or (b) A2 pulls B2 backward at the B36, in a slingshot manner to propel himself downfield, or (c) B3 grabs A3 and pulls him to the ground at the B36. The punt rolls into the end zone for a touchback. Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. Touchback. Not a foul. A kicking team player can use hands/arms to shed a block. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30, or fourth-and-20 on 50. The holding penalty by Team A is enforced from the dead ball spot (B20), or the previous spot. See 9-1-4. (c) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B10. The post possession foul is enforced from the end of the kick, the B20. See 9-1-4.  A.R. 9.65 TEAM A FOULS DURING PUNT\u2014DOUBLE CHANGE OF POSSESSION Fourth-and-10 on 50. A2 pulls B2 down by the facemask as A1 punts the ball. The ball is fielded at the B10 by B1, who runs to the B20 where he fumbles. A2 recovers at the B20 and runs to the B15 where he fumbles. B2 recovers and is tackled at the B12. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B27, or fourth-and-25 on A35. Because the opponent has possession at the end of the down, the FMM can be enforced from either the previous spot or the dead-ball spot.  A.R. 9.66 PUNT TOUCHED BY TEAM A PLAYER OUT OF BOUNDS IN END ZONE Fourth-and-10 on 50. The punt is bouncing toward the pylon. A1 steps on the sideline at the B1 and then dives for the ball, which is still airborne one yard in the end zone and bats it back to the B2. A2 recovers and falls to the ground at the B3. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. Touchback. The ball is dead at its most forward point at the time it is touched by someone or something that is out of bounds.

During B2\u2019s return, B3 blocks A4 in the back at the B26. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B5. Multiple fouls by Team B. The illegal substitution would be a post-possession foul enforced from the B10 to the B5. The block in the back would be enforced from the B26 to the B16. (14-1-3) (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B16. Multiple fouls by Team B.

Double fouls after a change of possession are offset at the spot where B\u2019s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. Here, since B1\u2019s foul is a post possession foul, that enforcement spot, (and therefore where these double fouls offset), would be either the end of the kick or the spot of B\u2019s foul, whichever is least advantageous for Team B. (14-5-2)  A.R. 9.71 KICKING TEAM PLAYER OUT OF BOUNDS DURING PUNT Fourth-and-12 on A21. At the snap, A1, who is lined up wide on punt coverage, runs out of bounds untouched to avoid being blocked by B1 and B2. A1 returns to the field of play at the A26. B1 attempts to catch the punted ball at the B41 but muffs it, and the ball rolls to the B19 where B3 and A4 simultaneously recover the ball. Ruling: Fourth-and-17 on A16 or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B24. Team B has the option to enforce the foul for a player illegally out of bounds on a kick at the previous spot or the dead ball spot. Simultaneous possession of a kick belongs to Team B.  A.R. 9.72 KICKING TEAM PLAYER OUT OF BOUNDS DURING PUNT\u2014RETURNS INBOUNDS Fourth-and-10 on A40. During the punt, flyer A2 is blocked out of bounds at the A45 and he (a) begins to run at an angle to return inbounds just after being forced out and returns inbounds at the B45, or (b) does not immediately run at an angle but runs parallel to the sideline and then returns inbounds at the B45. B3 fair catches the kick at the B20. Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first and ten on B20. No foul for not returning inbounds legally.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-ten on B35 or A\u2019s ball fourth-and-25 on A25. Unsportsmanlike conduct for not returning inbounds as quickly as is reasonable after being blocked out of bounds.  A.R. 9.73 KICKING TEAM PLAYER OUT OF BOUNDS DURING PUNT\u2014FORCED OUT Fourth-and-7 on A31. A1, who is attempting to cover the punt, is contacted and forced out of bounds by B3 at the A34. A1 begins to immediately run at an angle and returns to the field of play at the A39. B2 signals for and makes a fair catch at the B39.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B39. Contact by B3 is what caused A1 to run out of bounds and he immediately began to return at an angle, so there is no foul for a player out of bounds on a kick or for unsportsmanlike conduct.  A.R. 9.74 BLOCKING OUT OF BOUNDS DURING PUNT/DURING RETURN Fourth-and-10 on A40. A1\u2019s punt is fielded by B1 at the B10 and returned to the 50. B2 blocks A2 causing A2 to go out of bounds, and B3 then immediately goes out of bounds and blocks A2 again at the B40 while they are both out of bounds. The block by B3 occurs (a) during the kick; or (b) during the return. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B5.

B2 blocks A2 causing A2 to go out of bounds, and B3 then immediately goes out of bounds and blocks A2 again at the B40 while they are both out of bounds. The block by B3 occurs (a) during the kick; or (b) during the return. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B5. It is unnecessary roughness to go out of bounds to block an opponent during a punt. This is a post-possession foul. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. No foul. This action did not happen during the punt. (12-2-8-c)  A.R. 9.75 TOUCHBACK\u2014DOUBLE FOUL WITH CHANGE OF POSSESSION Fourth-and-3 on B36. During the punt, B2 clips A2 at the B16. The ball lands at the B6 and A3 bats the ball at the B4 into the end zone where B2 recovers the ball and runs for a touchdown. Team A had six players on the line of scrimmage. Ruling: Fourth-and-3 on B36, or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B8. This is a double foul with a change of possession. Both the illegal formation and illegal bat fouls by Team A were before the change of possession, and the clipping foul by Team B was a post possession foul. The ball was dead when it hit in the end zone, (untouched by B), so the result of the play is a touchback. Enforcement of B2\u2019s foul is from the spot of the foul, since it is behind the end of the kick (B20). Because this is a kick play, Team B also has the option to require a replay of the down.  A.R. 9.76 BALL TOUCHES OFFICIAL INBOUNDS DURING SCRIMMAGE KICK Fourth-and-5 on A45. A1 punts the ball to the B2 where it bounces and hits the Back Judge who was straddling the goal line. The ball bounces back to the B2 where it is downed by A2. If the ball had not struck the official, it would have gone into the end zone. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B2. If the ball touches an official who is inbounds, the touching is ignored. (7-2-2)  A.R. 9.77 TEAM A FIRST TOUCHES AND TEAM B ILLEGALLY KICKS PUNT Fourth-and-10 on 50. A1\u2019s punt is first touched by A2 on the B2. The ball then bounces to the B6 where B5 kicks it into and out of the back of the end zone.  Ruling: Safety. Safety kick A20. The illegal kick is a post-possession foul, which is enforced from the spot of the foul or the end of the kick, whichever is least beneficial to the receiving team. Because Team B\u2019s impetus caused the ball to go through the end zone, enforcement from the end of the kick results in a safety.

A1\u2019s punt is blocked at the A40, and the ball rolls loose on the ground at the A47, when A1 kicks it downfield. The ball hits B1 at the B45 and bounces out of bounds (a) at the B45 or (b) at the A45.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A40. Illegally kicking the ball during a loose ball behind the line of scrimmage is enforced from the previous spot with a loss of down. (Option to enforce from the dead ball spot)  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A35. Because the ball was punted, and because it was B\u2019s ball at the end of the punt play, the yardage can be enforced from the dead ball spot.   A.R. 9.79 PUNT\u2014ILLEGAL TOUCH Fourth-and-4 on A45. During the punt, flyer A2 inadvertently steps on the sideline at the B30, (not making an effort to avoid a player and not blocked out), as he is running downfield to cover the punt. He continues to run, immediately taking an angle and re-establishing himself in bounds, and falls on the ball (a) at the B5; or (b) at the B2.  Rulings:  (a) Fourth-and-9 on A40 or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B10. Illegal touch by A2. No kicking team player, who has been out of bounds, may touch or recover a punt beyond the line until it has been touched by another player from either team. If a punt team player goes out of bounds on his own to avoid a block, it is a foul. If he steps out inadvertently, it is not a foul for going out of bounds, but he still cannot be the first to touch the kick.  (b) Fourth-and-9 on A40, or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. The foul for illegal touching after having been out of bounds, if accepted, has a touchback option, as the touching occurred inside the five-yard line.   A.R. 9.80 PUNT\u2014MULTIPLE FOULS TEAM A\u2014ILLEGAL TOUCH AND POP Fourth-and-10 on 50. A1\u2019s punt is at the B17 when A2, who had re-established back inbounds after having gone out of bounds on his own to avoid a block, touches the rolling punt there. The punt then rolls out of bounds at the B14. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B19, or fourth-and-15 on A45. Multiple fouls by A2 for a player illegally out of bounds on a kick, and illegal touching of a kick. There is no option to move the ball to the spot of the first touch and also enforce the penalty from that spot.  A.R. 9.81 DOUBLE CHANGE OF POSSESSION\u2014FOUL DURING RETURN Fourth-and-10 on A40. B1 catches the punt on the B25 and runs to the B35 where he fumbles. A2 recovers the fumble at the B34 and runs to the B33 where he fumbles, and B2 recovers and is downed at the B30. During B1\u2019s run, B4 (a) illegally blocks in the back at the B37; (b) illegally blocks in the back at the B33; or (c) blocks A4 below the waist at the B32. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B25. Declining B\u2019s foul results in B\u2019s ball at the B30. When accepted, it is enforced from the B35 as a foul on a running play. There is no option to enforce B\u2019s foul from the dead-ball spot. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B23. Enforcement is from the spot of foul since it is behind the spot of the fumble. (c) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B19. Since the low block is a personal foul, Team A gets the ball back and the penalty is enforced from where Team A recovered B1\u2019s fumble.

The punted ball hits B1 in the hands and goes up in the air as B1 falls to the ground at the B12. A2 pushes B2 out of the way at the B10, catches the ball, and scores. B1 could not have caught the ball.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-goal on B10. The ball is dead where caught. B2 does not have protection, as he did not signal.  A.R. 10.2 FAIR-CATCH SIGNAL\u2014BLOCKED INTO PUNT Fourth-and-5 on 50. B1 signals for a fair catch at the B10. B1 then steps forward to the B13, allowing the ball to hit the ground behind him. A1 then blocks passive B1 (high) into the ball forcing it into the end zone. A2 recovers there. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. Touchback. No foul by A1, as a fair catch is no longer possible once the ball hits the ground. In addition, it is not a foul for fair catch interference, because B1 is not in position to catch the kick. B1 is deemed not to have touched the ball. The block by A1 is the impetus that put the ball into the end zone.   A.R. 10.3 NO FAIR CATCH\u2014CATCH COMPLETED OUT OF BOUNDS Fourth-and-12 on A12. The punt is shanked off the side of the kicker\u2019s foot. B1 is running toward the sideline at the B48 and gives a valid fair-catch signal. He catches the ball with one foot inbounds but his second step is out of bounds. Time in the game expires on the play. Ruling: Game over. There is no option for a fair-catch kick, as the fair catch was not completed inbounds.  A.R. 10.4 FAIR-CATCH SIGNAL\u2014BALL HITS TEAM A PLAYER\u2014LEGAL ADVANCE BY TEAM B Fourth-and-10 on A40. B1 gives a legal fair-catch signal at the B15 as the ball goes over his head. The ball in flight hits A2 at the B10, who is not near a Team B player. The ball bounces into the air toward B1, who catches it at the B12 and runs for a touchdown. Ruling: Touchdown, Team B. Kickoff B35.

B1 or B2 then recovers the ball at the B15 and runs to the 50 where he is tackled.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B15. The ball is dead when recovered by Team B.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A35. Fair Catch Interference. Legal return by Team B because the ball was touched by Team A. Because the opponent has possession at the end of the down, the FCI can be enforced from the dead-ball spot (c) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. Legal return by Team B because the ball was touched by Team A.  INVALID SIGNAL A.R. 10.6 INVALID FAIR-CATCH SIGNAL\u2014PUNT HITS GROUND Fourth-and 5 on A35. The punt is short and B1 gives a fair-catch signal at the B40 after the ball hits the ground at the B44. B2 picks up the ball at the B44 and scores.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B35. Five-yard penalty enforced from the spot of the foul for giving a signal after the ball hit the ground.  Note: The ball is dead when recovered by B2 after the ball hits the ground.  A.R. 10.7 INVALID FAIR-CATCH SIGNAL\u2014KICKOFF HITS GROUND On an onside kick from the A35, A1 \u201ctops\u201d the ball causing it to go down into the ground and then bounce high in the air to the A45 where it comes down to waiting B1. B1 signals for a fair catch, but just before B1 catches the ball, A2 blocks him aside and the ball hits the ground and is recovered by B3 at the A45. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. Invalid fair-catch signal as the ball had hit the ground before the signal. The action by A2 was legal both, because the ball had hit the ground (no interference with the opportunity), and because the block occurred beyond the receiver\u2019s restraining line after the ball hit the ground. The foul for an invalid signal is enforced from the spot of the foul.   A.R. 10.8 INVALID FAIR-CATCH SIGNAL\u2014ANOTHER TEAM B PLAYER CATCHES Fourth-and-5 on A40. B1 gives an invalid fair-catch signal at the B14. The wind carries the punted ball in the air to the B8 where B2 catches the ball. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B8. Team A would take the result of the play since the penalty would place the ball at the B9. The ball is dead when caught.   A.R. 10.9 INVALID FAIR-CATCH SIGNAL\u2014INTERFERENCE WITH OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH KICK Fourth-and-10 on A40. A1 punts and B1 gives an invalid fair-catch signal at the B25.

Because Team B lost possession during the down, its foul is not post-possession, so the fouls offset at the previous spot. (14-5-2)  A.R. 10.10 INVALID FAIR-CATCH SIGNAL\u2014MUFF BY TEAM B Fourth-and-10 on A40. A1 punts and B1 gives an invalid fair-catch signal and muffs the ball up into the air.

Just before the ball arrives, A4 lowers his helmet and hits B2 in the chin, causing B2 to muff the punt which is recovered by A6. Officials penalize A4 and disqualify him.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30, or A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-25 on A30. Enforcement for both the kick catch interference and personal foul would be 15 yards from the spot of the foul, but only one foul can be enforced.

Tight end A2 goes into the end zone and leaps to catch a pass from A1. While he is airborne in the end zone, A2 controls the ball and is driven back to the 1-yard line by B2, where A2 lands on both feet, and not sure if he had scored, breaks free from B2, runs and it tackled at the 1- yard line.  Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. Once A2 comes down and completes the catch, the play is over, and he is given his forward progress.   A.R. 11.2 TOUCHDOWN\u2014BATTED PASS IN END ZONE Third-and-3 on B16. A1 throws a forward pass to end A2 along the end line. A2 bats the ball toward end A3 who catches it in the end zone.

The result of the play is a safety, so if that option is elected, the Team B foul is enforced on the kickoff, because it is a B foul during a Try that is not used for a re-Try, to negate a score, or as part of a double foul. If A3 had recovered the ball at the B3, the play would have been blown dead, since he was not the fumbling player.

A.R. 11.16  UNSUCCESSFUL TRY \u2013 OFFENSIVE FOUL On a Try attempt from the B2, A1 runs and fumbles the ball at the line of scrimmage. At the snap, A2 grabs and pulls B2\u2019s facemask prior to the fumble. B1 recovers the loose ball, runs, and fumbles the ball at the B20. A2 picks up the loose ball, runs, and is tackled at the B1. Ruling: Unsuccessful Try. Kickoff A20. The facemask foul can be enforced on the kickoff because it was not used to negate a score or offset another foul.  A.R. 11.17 TRY-KICK ATTEMPT\u20145 VS. 15 During a successful or unsuccessful Kick-Try from the B15, B2 is called for leverage. A1 was illegally in motion at the snap. Ruling: Re-Try at B7\u00bd (kick) or B1 (run or pass) (A\u2019s option). This is a 5 vs. 15, as there was no change of possession. There is no option for Team A to decline the re-Try and enforce the yardage on the ensuing kickoff, because the fouls are \u201cused\u201d as a part of the double foul enforcement. When fouls by both teams occur during a Try down with no change of possession, the down must be replayed. The only exception to this would be a clean hands score (11-3-3-item 5).

This is a pre-snap 5 vs. 15 with the major foul on Team B. Since the dead ball fouls prevented the snap, Team A can either enforce the major foul on the Try or enforce it on the kickoff. (14-5-1-Exc. 3)   Note: If the major foul of a pre-snap 5 vs. 15 is on Team A, there is no option for Team B to enforce the penalty yardage on the kickoff. Pre-snap fouls by Team A (after the ready for play), must be enforced on the succeeding Try down.   A.R. 11.19 TRY-KICK ATTEMPT\u20145 VS. 15\u2014CLEAN HANDS SCORE During a successful Try from the B15, B2 is offside, and after the ball is dead, A2 is called for unnecessary roughness. Ruling: The Kick-Try is good. Kickoff A20. This is a clean hands score, so the score counts, and the foul against A2 is enforced on the kickoff.

The ball is snapped directly to the kicker, and he drop kicks the ball between the uprights. B3 was covering the center at the snap. Ruling: One-point Try successful, kickoff A40; or re-Try at the B1 (run or pass), kickoff A35. The restriction for Team B players covering the center applies on drop kicks, if there is a normal kicking formation with a holder in place prior to the snap.

Rulings:  (a) Re-Try B2 (run or pass) or B15 (kick). If Team B fouls prior to the initial change of possession, the Try is replayed, regardless of subsequent fouls by either team. In this case, the fouls offset at either Try spot.  (b) Try no good, KO A35. This is not a 5 vs. 15 as there was a change of possession and neither foul is enforced on the kickoff.  (c) Try no good, KO A35. Since both teams fouled after the change of possession, the fouls offset and are not enforced on the kickoff.

Team A elects to have the 10-yard penalty enforced from the B15 and attempt a kick-Try from the B25. Before the snap for the kick, B3 encroaches.  Ruling: Re-Try B20 (kick), kickoff A35; re-Try B7 (run or pass), kickoff A35; re-Try B25 (kick), kickoff A40; or re-Try B12 (run or pass) kickoff A40, Team A always has the option to enforce a Team B foul on the kickoff, or from the previous spot or the other Try spot, the location of which is determined by any previously enforced penalty, if applicable. Team A, after enforcement, can also choose where the ball is spotted between the hash marks.   A.R. 11.25 TRY-KICK ATTEMPT\u2014PASS INTERFERENCE AND FACEMASK On a kick Try from the B15, holder A2 muffs the snap at the B23, and kicker A1 recovers at the B25 where he throws a forward pass to eligible receiver A4, who is grabbed and pulled down by the facemask before the ball arrives at the B4. The pass falls incomplete.  Ruling: Re-Try B2 (kick) or Re-Try B\u00bd (run/pass). If Team A chooses to again attempt a 1-point kick Try, the pass interference is a spot foul putting the ball at the B4, plus half the distance to the B2 because the pass interference is also a personal foul. If Team A chooses to Try from the \u201cother spot: (run/pass), the enforcement is half the distance to the goal line from the B2, and half the distance again as a result of the personal foul on the pass interference.

B2 intercepts a pass in the end zone, and while running in the end zone, fumbles the ball which rolls to the B3. B4 then bats the loose ball forward to the B7-yard line where B5 recovers.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B1\u00bd.   Note: Since Team A\u2019s impetus put the ball in the end zone, the B20 is considered the spot of the fumble. The Team B foul is therefore enforced from the spot of the foul, because it\u2019s behind the spot of the fumble. If Team B\u2019s impetus had put the ball in the end zone, the spot of the fumble would be in the end zone, so the result would be a safety.

A\u2019s punt is at the B5 when B3 bats the ball backward over the end line, creating new impetus. Immediately after the snap, B3 head slaps A2 on the line of scrimmage.  Ruling: Safety. Safety kick B10. A bat (legal or illegal) creates a new impetus, so the result of the play is a safety, and the personal foul carries over to the safety kick.   Note: If the foul is committed in an effort to block the kick, it is not a post possession foul, so there is also an option to enforce the foul from the previous spot with an automatic first down, although Team A would likely choose the points and have Team B safety kick from the B10.   A.R. 11.31 MOMENTUM\u2014ILLEGAL FORWARD PASS\u2014SAFETY Third-and-goal on B6. A1 throws to A3 in the end zone near the goal line. B2 intercepts at the B1-yard line with one foot at the B1-yard line and the other on the B\u00bd-yard line. His momentum carries him into the end zone where he attempts a backward pass which goes forward. A3 muffs the pass at the B\u00bd-yard line, and it falls incomplete. Ruling: Safety. Safety kick B20. Although B2\u2019s momentum took him into his end zone, his foul for an illegal forward pass in the end zone creates a safety.   A.R. 11.32 SAFETY\u2014NOT MOMENTUM EXCEPTION \u2013 FOUL AGAINST AN OFFICIAL Third-and 25 on B40. The score is tied 21-21 at the two-minute warning of the fourth quarter. On a long pass thrown toward the goal line, B2 dives in front of receiver A2 and intercepts the ball at the B4. He slides untouched to a stop on the B1, gets to his feet, and to avoid tackler A3, loops into the end zone where he is tackled by A4. The Field Judge signals safety. B2 is infuriated by the ruling and slams the ball at the officials\u2019 feet.  Ruling: Safety. Safety kick B10. B2\u2019s momentum did not take him into the end zone. A second unsportsmanlike conduct foul of this category would lead to disqualification.  A.R. 11.33 PUNT\u2014TEAM A FOULS IN OWN END ZONE\u2014OPTIONS FOR TEAM B Fourth-and-9 on A2. Prior to A1 punting the ball from the end zone, A3 holds B2 on a block initiated in the end zone. The punt is then shanked out of bounds at the A16.  Ruling: Safety, safety kick A20. There is no option to enforce from the dead-ball spot unless it is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul.  A.R. 11.34 NO SAFETY\u2014MOMENTUM EXCEPTION Fourth-and-6 on B45. On the last play of the first half, B1 catches a punt on the B2-yard line and the momentum of the kick forces him back into the end zone. B1 is then tackled by A2 in the end zone.  Ruling: Half over. The ball would be spotted on the B2-yard line because of the momentum exception; however, time expired on the play.  A.R. 11.35 SAFETY KICK\u2014OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014POTENTIAL EXTENSION OF PERIOD  Third-and-8 on A5. Quarterback A1 is sacked in his own end zone. On the ensuing safety kick, A3 punts the ball out of bounds at the B30.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. The penalty for a safety kick kicked out of bounds is 30 yards from the spot of the kick, or the out-of-bounds spot. If the safety occurred due to a foul by Team A in their own end zone, with no time left in the game, Team B would have the option to extend for an untimed down.

The fumble forward out of bounds, returns the ball to the spot of the fumble in the end zone. The ball is therefore dead in B\u2019s possession in the end zone, thus giving B the ball at that spot of interception momentum (B6). B\u2019s foul is enforced from the spot of the foul, which is behind the momentum spot.   A.R. 11.38 MOMENTUM EXCEPTION\u2014FOUL IN FIELD OF PLAY First-and-10 on B16. B1 intercepts a pass at the B6, and his momentum carries him into the end zone. While still in the end zone, B1 throws a backward pass to B2, which goes over the end line. During B1\u2019s run in the end zone, B4 tripped A3 at the B8.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B3. Since the ball is dead in Team B\u2019s possession in the end zone, the dead ball spot is the momentum spot - the B6. The tripping foul is therefore enforced from the B6, (the dead ball spot), rather than the spot of the foul - the B8.   A.R. 11.39 MOMENTUM\u2014ILLEGAL FORWARD PASS TEAM B IN OWN END ZONE\u2014INTERCEPTION TEAM A First-and-10 on B16. B1 intercepts a pass or recovers a fumble or backward pass by A1 at the B6, and his momentum carries him into the end zone. B1 tries to run the ball out, sees that he will be tackled, and throws an illegal forward pass to B2 which is intercepted by A3 at the B2-yard line and carried into the end zone.  Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. Decline the foul for illegal forward pass because enforcement would result in a safety.  A.R. 11.40 MOMENTUM\u2014FUMBLE RECOVERY On a kickoff from the A35, B2 returns the ball to the A15-yard line where the ball is punched out of his hands from behind by A1. The ball is scooped up by A1 on the run at the A6, and his momentum carries him forward into his end zone, where (a) A1 is tackled; or (b) A1 fumbles the ball and B2 recovers it in A\u2019s end zone.  Rulings: (a) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A6. Team A was the defensive team when A1 recovered B2\u2019s fumble, so the momentum exception applies.  (b) Touchdown Team B. Kickoff B35. The ball was not dead in the end zone in A\u2019s possession; therefore, there is no momentum exception.   Note: Momentum only applies to the team that has just gained possession after a change of possession. In this case, it would be Team A after recovery of a fumble by Team B. Momentum does not apply to a team regaining possession of their own fumble, pass or kick.  A.R. 11.41 NOT MOMENTUM\u2014PROGRESS STOPPED Third-and-6 on B16. A1 throws a pass toward A3 in the end zone. B2 intercepts the ball with both feet down at the B1-yard line and is driven back into the end zone by A6. B2 fumbles over the end line as he is tackled by A6. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B1. Forward progress at the B1-yard line. For the momentum exception to apply, B2\u2019s own momentum must cause him to go into the end zone.  A.R. 11.42 NOT MOMENTUM\u2014BALL NOT DEAD IN THE END ZONE\u2014FORWARD PROGRESS First-and-10 on B16. B1 recovers a fumble by A1 at the B6, and his momentum causes him to slide feet first into the end zone where he is touched down by A2. Both of B1\u2019s feet are in the end zone, but the ball is at the B\u00bd. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B\u00bd. The ball must get into the end zone for the momentum exception to apply. In this case, B1\u2019s forward progress is deemed stopped at the B\u00bd.  A.R. 11.43 MOMENTUM\u2014PASS INTERCEPTED AT GOAL LINE First-and-10 on B25.

A1\u2019s pass is intercepted by B1 at the B5, and his momentum carries him into the end zone where he falls to the ground and is touched down. While B1\u2019s momentum was taking him into the end zone, B3 blocked A3 low in the end zone.  Ruling: Safety. Safety kick B20. Even though his momentum takes him into the end zone, Team B fouled in its own end zone during the run which results in a safety. It would also be a safety if B1 was downed in the field of play. (14-4-4)  A.R. 11.47 NOT MOMENTUM\u2014FUMBLE IN END ZONE\u2014BALL DECLARED DEAD IN FIELD OF PLAY Third-and-10 on B40. A1\u2019s pass is intercepted by B1 at the B6, and his momentum carries him into the end zone where he scrambles to try and run it out. While he is running in the end zone, B1 fumbles, and the ball rolls out to the B5 where it is recovered by B1. During the fumble, while the ball was rolling in the field of play, B2 holds A2: (a) at the B4; or (b) in the end zone.  Rulings:  (a) Safety. Safety kick B20.

FIELD GOAL A.R. 11.48 MISSED FIELD GOAL\u2014DOWNED OR ADVANCED BY TEAM A  Fourth-and-4 on B36. Team A\u2019s field-goal attempt from the B44 is partially blocked, and the ball (a) bounces in the end zone and rolls over the end line; (b) hits on the B33 and then bounces to the B37 where Team A recovers and downs it; or (c) hits on the B33 and then bounces back to the B37 where A2 recovers the ball and advances to the B34.  Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B44.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B37.  (c) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B34.  Note: If the kick ends behind the line of scrimmage, the option to return to the spot of the kick (or 20) is lost. This includes a play in which the kick has been beyond the line and returns behind it, regardless of whether it was or was not touched beyond the line.   A.R. 11.49 MISSED FIELD GOAL\u2014TEAM A FOUL Fourth-and-10 on B24. A1 attempts a field goal from the B32 which is partially blocked and is rolling on the ground at the B8, when it is touched there by B2. It is then recovered by A3 at the B3. During the field-goal attempt, A3 stepped on the sideline at the B15 to avoid B7\u2019s block (no contact by B) before recovering the ball. Ruling: Fourth-and-15 on B29. It is a five-yard penalty for a kicking team player to voluntarily go out of bounds to avoid being blocked during the kick. The only option for enforcing the foul by Team A is the previous spot. If the foul were to be declined, it would be A\u2019s ball at the B3.  A.R. 11.50 MISSED FIELD GOAL \u2013 TEAM A FOUL Fourth-and-Seven on B37. Kicker A1 attempts a field goal from the B45.

Ruling: Fourth-and-5 on B38. If Team A declines the defense offside penalty, Team B will get the ball at the spot of the kick - the 50-yard line - as a result of the missed field goal. If a Team B penalty is declined, that penalty does not affect Team B\u2019s option to take the ball at the spot of the kick on a missed field goal.

Rulings (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B18. If a third down scrimmage kick goes out of bounds or is simultaneously recovered, the ball belongs to Team B. (b) Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. Since the scrimmage kick was recovered by Team A behind the line of scrimmage, the advance is legal. (c) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B21. If a third down scrimmage kick is simultaneously recovered, the ball belongs to Team B. (d) A\u2019s ball fourth-and-12 on B19.

During a field-goal attempt from the B25, A6 and A7 chop block B8 at the line of scrimmage. The kick is blocked and: (a) goes out of bounds at the B22; (b) B2 tries to recover the ball at the B14 but muffs it out of bounds at the B12; (c) rolls to the B5 where A2 downs it there; (d) goes to the B6 where B3 falls on the ball; or (e) is recovered by B4 at the B2 and is advanced to the A35 where he is tackled.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B37. On a missed field-goal attempt, a UNR/UNS foul by the kicking team is enforced from the succeeding spot when the receiving team is awarded the ball. The succeeding spot is where the kick ends behind the line of scrimmage. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B27. Since Team B touched the ball beyond the line of scrimmage, the succeeding spot is where the ball becomes dead in its possession. (c) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B40.

Since Team B downed the ball beyond the line of scrimmage, the succeeding spot is where the ball becomes dead in B\u2019s possession. (e) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A20. Team B can recover and advance the ball because it is a scrimmage kick. The succeeding spot is the end of the run and Team A\u2019s foul will be enforced from that spot.  A.R. 11.61 MISSED FIELD GOAL\u2014TEAM B FOULS AFTER THE KICK Fourth-and-4 on B35. A1\u2019s field-goal attempt from the B43 is partially blocked at the line of scrimmage. The ball rolls out of bounds at the B15. While the ball was loose, B2 clips at the B12.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B6. This is a post possession foul, because the foul did not occur in an effort to block the kick.  A.R. 11.62 MISSED FIELD GOAL\u2014DOUBLE FOUL WITH CHANGE OF POSSESSION Fourth-and-10 on B20. A field-goal attempt from the B28 is partially blocked and rolls out of bounds at the B30. Team A had only six men on the line. After the kick is out of bounds, B1 clips at the B10.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B15, or A\u2019s ball fourth-and-10 on B20 Replay. Double foul with a change of possession.   A.R. 11.63 MISSED FIELD GOAL\u2014DOUBLE FOUL WITH CHANGE OF POSSESSION Fourth-and-5 on B30. A1\u2019s field-goal attempt from the B38 is blocked behind the line of scrimmage. B3 picks up the loose ball and runs for a touchdown. During B3\u2019s run, B4 blocks low at the A15. A2 was illegally in motion at the snap.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A30. Double foul with a change of possession. They also would have the option to replay the down, but Team B would never take that option.  A.R. 11.64 MISSED FIELD GOAL \u2013 DOUBLE FOUL AFTER A CHANGE OF POSSESSION Fourth-and-5 on B30. A1\u2019s field-goal attempt from the B38 is partially blocked at the line of scrimmage. B3 picks up the loose ball at the B10 and runs to the B30, where A3 pulls him down by the facemask. While the kick was rolling at the B20, B1 clipped A2 at the B15.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B10. This is a double foul after a change of possession, since B\u2019s foul was a post possession foul during the kick.

A1\u2019s field-goal attempt from the B38 is partially blocked at the line of scrimmage. B3 picks up the loose ball at the B10 and runs to the B30, where A3 pulls him down by the facemask. While the kick was rolling at the B20, B1 clipped A2 at the B15.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B10. This is a double foul after a change of possession, since B\u2019s foul was a post possession foul during the kick. The fouls offset at the end of the kick, since that spot is behind the spot of the foul.

Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A40. A missed fair catch kick is treated the same as a missed field goal. The Referee would wind the clock when the ball is kicked.  A.R. 11.66 FIELD GOAL GOOD\u2014FOUL BY TEAM B Fourth-and-5 on B22. A1\u2019s field-goal attempt from the B30 is good. On the play, B3 head slaps A2 on the line of scrimmage immediately after the snap, displacing A2, to allow a teammate to shoot through in an attempt to block the kick. Ruling: Option: Award three points and kickoff 50, or A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B11. The head slap is a foul for unnecessary roughness.  A.R. 11.67 FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT HITS OFFICIAL Fourth-and-5 on B15. A\u2019s field-goal attempt from the B23 is low and the ball hits the Side Judge prior to going over the upright.

Extend for one down; 5 vs. 15 with the major live ball foul by the defense. Had the kick been unsuccessful, there would be a change of possession, thus no 5 vs. 15. The down would be replayed at the previous spot.  Note: If B2\u2019s foul had been a dead ball penalty after the kick was declared dead, the game would be over with Team B winning 33-32, no enforcement of the penalty, and no extension.

(5 vs. 15 with the major foul by the offense.) (14-5-1-Exc 1, 4-8-2-h-Exc 2) Had the kick been unsuccessful, there would be a change of possession, thus no 5 vs. 15. The down would be replayed at the previous spot.   A.R. 11.70 FIELD-GOAL ATTEMPT\u2014DROP KICK\u2014ON OR BEHIND THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE Fourth-and-Seven on B10. Team A trails 23-20 and lines up for a field goal from the B18 with 0:42 remaining in the game. Holder A2 muffs the snap and Kicker A1 recovers the ball at the B16 and runs to the B10 where he drop kicks the ball through the uprights with 0:35 remaining. The ball is dropped just inside the B10, but part of A1\u2019s body is still on or behind the B10.  Ruling: Field goal good. Kickoff A35. (On a scrimmage kick, the kicker\u2019s entire body and ball must be beyond the line of scrimmage for this to be illegal).  TOUCHBACK A.R. 11.71 TOUCHBACK\u2014KICKOFF\u2014FUMBLE OVER END LINE On a kickoff, B1 catches the ball in the end zone, and while running there, he fumbles the ball over the end line.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B25. The impetus is from the kick.  A.R. 11.72 TOUCHBACK\u2014PUNT\u2014TEAM A DOES NOT RE-ESTABLISH IN FIELD OF PLAY Fourth-and-4 on A45. A1 punts the ball which bounces on the B2. Kicking-team member A3 goes into the end zone and jumps from the end zone and controls the ball while airborne and lands on the B1-yard line.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. Touchback. To prevent a touchback, the kicking team member must re-establish himself in the field of play prior to touching the ball. The play is dead as soon as he touches the ball.   A.R. 11.73 TOUCHBACK AND PERSONAL FOUL\u2014IMPETUS BY TEAM B Third-and-8 on A5. A1 takes the snap and hands the ball forward to back A2 at the A4.

B2 attempts to scoop the ball, but instead muffs it into A\u2019s end zone. A4 recovers and is tackled in the end zone by his facemask.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A35. Touchback. Because the ball was at rest, Team B\u2019s impetus put the ball in the end zone, and the personal foul is enforced from the 20-yard line.

Team B elects to extend the period by a fair-catch kick. On the fair-catch kick from the A33, B3 (the kicking team) is offside. The ball goes through the uprights.  Ruling: Go to overtime. No score. Since this is an offensive foul, the penalty is not enforced, and the score is negated.  A.R. 11.75 MUFFED SNAP ON FIELD GOAL\u2014INTENTIONAL GROUNDING OR NOT Third-and-10 on B15. With 15 seconds remaining in the game, Team A lines up to attempt a game-winning field goal from the B23. Holder A2 muffs the snap, picks the ball up off the ground, and realizes that the field-goal attempt would now be blocked. Therefore, while still on his knees at the B22, A2: (a) shovels the ball toward his wingback where it hits the ground behind the wingback who is not looking; or (b) spikes the ball into the ground directly in front of him. There were 11 seconds on the clock when the pass hit the ground. Rulings:  (a) Fourth-and-10 on B15. Incomplete pass. No foul.  (b) Fourth-and-20 on B25. Intentional grounding.

After he wipes his hands, the holder (a) throws the towel away and behind where he is kneeling or (b) drops the towel directly in front of him. The snap is made and the kick is good. Ruling: (a) and (b) Try is good, KO A35. The holder is allowed to bring a towel out to the field that measures 6\u201d by 8\u201d and should be tucked into his waistband after use.

A2 pulls B2 out of the way at B40, runs downfield, and makes the tackle on the punt return man B3 at B10. B3 fumbles and A3 recovers and is downed at the B15.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 at B15.

This is defensive holding, not tripping.  A.R. 12.8 BLOCK IN THE BACK\u2014INTO THE TACKLE Fourth-and-10 on A40. A1\u2019s punt is fielded by B1 at the B10, and during the return, B2 pushes A2 squarely in the back at the B15, but the push actually pushes A2 into B1 at the B12 where he makes the tackle.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B6. This is a foul for a block in the back.   A.R. 12.9 PASS BLOCKING\u2014BLOCK IN THE BACK Second-and-10 on B40. As quarterback A1 is in the pocket, lineman A2 is attempting to block defensive end B2. B2 gets completely past A2, and (a) A2; or (b) A3 (another lineman) pushes B2 directly in the back, pushing him past A1. A1 then completes the pass for a touchdown.  Rulings: In both (a) and (b): Touchdown. This is a legal block because the contact occurred while the quarterback was still in the pocket.   A.R. 12.10 PASS BLOCKING\u2014QB OUT OF THE POCKET\u2014BLOCK IN THE BACK Second-and-10 on B40. After quarterback A1 has scrambled out of the pocket, lineman A2 loses contact with defensive end B2. B2 has an unrestricted path to A1, but A2 pushes B2 directly in the back, causing him to miss the tackle. A1 passes to A2 for a touchdown.  Ruling: Second-and-20 on 50. The illegal block in the back should be called, because the quarterback was, (or had been), out of the pocket.  A.R. 12.11 BLOCK IN THE BACK\u2014PUNT IN THE AIR\u2014TEAM A OR B Fourth-and-10 on 50. While A1\u2019s punt is in the air: (a) B1 blocks flyer A2 in the back at the B18 and then B1 fair catches the punt at the B12; (b) B1 blocks flyer A2 in the back at the B18 and then the untouched punt rolls into the end zone; or (c) A3 blocks B4 in the back at the B40, after which the untouched punt rolls into the end zone.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B6. Post possession enforcement. (12-1-3-b)  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B9. Since the ball is still alive at the time of the block, this is post-possession enforcement from the spot of the foul, which is behind the end of the kick (B20).  (c) Fourth-and-20 on A40 or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30.   A.R. 12.12 OFFENSIVE HOLDING AT TIME OF TACKLE As B1 is returning the opening kickoff, (a) B2 holds A2 as A2 is making the tackle at the B30; or (b) B2 holds A2 at the B30, five yards away from the runner, as B1 is being tackled by A3 at the B35.  Rulings:  (a)  B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B35. No foul. Offensive Holding will not be called if the runner is being simultaneously tackled by any defensive player.   (b)  B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B35. No foul.  A.R. 12.13 TRIPPING OR LEG WHIP Second-and-10 on B40. As QBA1 drops back to pass, blocker A2 is beaten by B2 on the pass rush. A2 falls to the ground and (a) throws his leg out (no whipping motion); or (b) whips his leg around in an attempt to keep B2 from sacking the quarterback. A2\u2019s leg makes contact with B2 either above or below the knees. A1 runs to the B15. Rulings:  (a) Second-and-20 on 50. Tripping. (12-1-8)  (b) Second-and-25 on A45. Unnecessary roughness (leg whip). In both situations, if there is a whipping motion, it is a personal foul for a leg whip, regardless of where the contact occurs.

A.R. 12.14 ILLEGALLY KICKING/BATTING THE BALL\u2014POTENTIAL RUNOFF AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Third-and-5 at B40. There is 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter, and Team B is ahead in the score, 22-20. QB A1 muffs a hand to hand snap, and while the ball is loose on the ground (a) at the B41, or (b) at the B38, A1 deliberately kicks or bats it out of bounds at the B34.  Rulings: (a) and (b) Fourth-and-15 on 50. This is a foul during a fumble, so the enforcement spot is the spot of the fumble. Since that spot is behind the line of scrimmage, the foul is enforced from the previous spot, with a loss of down. In addition, Team B can elect a 10-second runoff and start the clock on the ready, as this was an intentional foul that stopped the clock. It is a 10-yard penalty and a loss of down for Team A to illegally kick or bat the ball on a scrimmage play.  Note: If the foul for illegal kicking or batting occurs beyond the line of scrimmage on a scrimmage kick play, the foul is enforced as a foul on a scrimmage kick play, and there is no loss of down.

Punter A1 muffs the snap at the A33 where it hits the ground. A1 recovers the ball at the A30, and is run into by B1 while punting the ball. B2 recovers the ball at the B25.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 at B25. No foul. Once the ball hits the ground on a punt, there can be no roughing or running into the kicker. Normal unnecessary roughness protection applies.  A.R. 12.17 RUNNING INTO OR ROUGHING THE KICKER Fourth-and 6 on A45. A1 punts the ball which goes out of bounds at the B10. B1, attempting to block the punt: (a) brushes A1 with his right shoulder, but A1 remains upright; (b) hits A1\u2019s kicking leg while it is extended, knocking A1 to the ground; (c) slides into A1\u2019s plant leg, knocking him to the ground; (d) hits A1\u2019s plant leg directly, knocking A1 to the ground; or (e) collides with A1 in the inner-thigh area or torso of his body, knocking A1 to the ground.

Roughing the kicker.   A.R. 12.18 RUNNING/ROUGHING/UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS\u2014BALL SKIPS OFF GROUND Fourth-and-3 on A45. The snap to punter A1 is low and skips off the ground once, but is fielded cleanly by A1, and A1 is able to begin his normal punting motion. (a) B2 runs into A1 (not roughing); (b) B2 collides with A2 squarely in the torso (normally enough for roughing); or (c) B2 throws a forearm into A2\u2019s helmet. B2 does not block the punt. The punt is shanked out of bounds on the B45.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B45. No foul for running into the kicker, since the snap hit the ground. (12-2-10-e)  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B45. No foul for roughing the kicker, since the snap hit the ground. (12-2-10-e)  (c) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B40. Unnecessary roughness.

ROUGHING THE PASSER The following mechanics and interpretations pertain to quarterback protection:  (1) When a quarterback runs an option and keeps the ball, he is a runner. He has none of the special protections given to a passer. Normal unnecessary roughness rules apply. It does not matter whether he is in or outside the pocket area. If the quarterback on an option pitches the ball to a player, his only protection before or after the pitch is that provided under normal unnecessary roughness rules. He does not receive any of the special protections granted to a player who throws a forward pass while on the run. The player who receives the pitch does not have any special \u201cdefenseless player\u201d protection. (2) When the passer goes outside the pocket area and either continues moving with the ball (without attempting to advance the ball as a runner) or throws while on the run, he loses the protection of the one-step rule and the protection against a low hit, but retains the other special protections afforded to a passer in the pocket. If a quarterback attempts to advance the ball as a runner, he loses all of the special protections of the roughing-the-passer rule. However, if he throws while on the run, he regains all the special protections except the one-step rule and low hit rule. If he stops behind the line and clearly establishes a passing posture, he is covered by all of the special protections for passers.", "start_char_idx": 2617, "end_char_idx": 5096, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3a4a35c-9e4a-4830-bd57-1b5a365d9115": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3a4a35c-9e4a-4830-bd57-1b5a365d9115", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "173", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "148d5d1e-6bbc-4f50-bbe5-937c2372e634", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "173", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "68f3a7f616ee9bf14f5973b700d37546f08e57fd8ee9181c4faadee37037507b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "807e87bf-afa9-47cb-85f7-1863e3885813", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "0cd6f909c36dceec0397fcaed4627514311fe58d58b147a89149341765445615", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc84aca4-70b2-4d22-8688-4d386d806d0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a4068b7b1de57c34b74cb43cba25f1df70f5ef4d39e6d46f170991e152ce809c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "77 (3) When a quarterback retreats to pass, but brings the ball down and begins to advance as a runner, he no longer has roughing-the-passer protection, even when his path of advance is within the pocket.

(5) When a quarterback hands off to a teammate and carries out his fake, his only protection is normal unnecessary roughness rules. Helmet-to-helmet contact is not necessarily illegal. (6) If a defensive player is blocked or fouled into the quarterback and violates any of the roughing-the-passer rules, it is not a foul unless the contact is avoidable.

Quarterback A1 rolls out of the pocket, and while moving, completes a pass to A2 who runs out of bounds at the B12. Just after A1 released the ball, B1 launches and hits A1 in the chest area with the hairline part of the helmet and then continues to rip up and contact A1 under the chin with his helmet.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-goal on B6. Roughing the passer.  A.R. 12.22 ROUGHING THE PASSER Third-and-5 on 50. Quarterback A1, in the pocket, throws a pass to A2, who runs for a touchdown. Just after A1 released the ball, B1 lowers his head and hits A1 with the hairline part of his helmet in the chest area.  Ruling: Touchdown Team A, with the option to enforce the roughing the passer foul on the Try or the kickoff.   A.R. 12.23 ROUGHING/NOT ROUGHING THE PASSER (NO PASS THROWN) Second-and-10 on B35. Quarterback A1 drops back to pass, and while he is standing in the pocket at the B46, B1 tackles him from behind by (a) driving the crown of his helmet into the back of A1; (b) contacting A1\u2019s head with his forearm; (c) forcibly tackling A1 below the knees; or (d) diving and landing on the ground while swiping with his arm and catching A1 around the calf. A1 lands on the ground at the B45.  Rulings:  (a), (b), and (c): First-and-10 on B20. Roughing the passer. (12-2-9)  (d) Third-and-20 on B45. No foul. Not forcible contact in the knee area or below.   A.R. 12.24 ROUGHING THE PASSER\u2014FUMBLE RECOVERED BY DEFENSE Second-and-2 on B35. Quarterback A1 drops back to pass. B1 tackles him from behind by driving his lowered head into the back of A1, contacting A1\u2019s head with his forearm, or tackling A1 below the knees at the B44. As A1 is hit, the ball leaves A1\u2019s hand at the B45. The Referee correctly rules fumble. B2 recovers the ball at the B47. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. The quarterback was in a passing posture, so in each instance it is a foul for roughing the passer.   A.R. 12.25 ROUGHING THE PASSER\u2014ILLEGAL FORWARD PASS Second-and-10 at the 50. A1 scrambles, runs to the B49, retreats to the A45, and then passes the ball to A2 at the B40. After the ball has left A1\u2019s hand, B1 takes two steps and hits Quarterback A1 facemask-to-facemask as he tackles him.  Ruling: Second-and-10 on 50. Roughing the Passer and Illegal Forward Pass This is not a 5 vs 15 because the IFP foul carries a loss of down penalty, so the fouls offset at the previous spot.

A2 takes a handoff from a shotgun or T-QB and starts to sweep around the right end. As he is (a) behind the normal position of the right tackle, or (b) behind the normal position of the tight end, he stops and changes direction toward the middle of the field. Left tackle A3 sees A2 change direction, runs toward him, and forcibly blocks defensive end B2 at the A28 in the chest with his head (not UOH), forearm, or shoulder. The block occurs behind the normal right guard position and is parallel to the line of scrimmage. A2 runs to the 50, where he is tackled.   Rulings:  (a) First-and-10 on the 50. This is a legal block, as it occurred within the tackle to tackle area, within 3 yards of the line of scrimmage, and before the ball left that area.  (b) Second-and-20 on A15. Blindside block. Although this block occurs within the tackle to tackle area, and within 3 yards of the line of scrimmage, the block occurred after the ball left that area.   Note: Once the ball leaves the tackle to tackle area within 3 yards of the line of scrimmage, the area disappears and a block that satisfies the requirements of a blindside block is illegal even if the ball re-enters that area.   A.R. 12.47 CRACKBACK\u2014UNBALANCED FORMATION\u2014FLEXED First-and-10 on B25. Left tackle A3 lines up on the right side of the line, creating an unbalanced formation, with tight end A2 lined up to the right of A3. Right tight end A2 then cracks back at the line of scrimmage. A1 runs around right end to the B15.  Ruling: First-and-25 on B40. A2 is flexed and thus prohibited from cracking back.

During the return, at the B40, A1 dives low in an attempt to tackle B1, and in the process: (a) goes through B2 below the waist before making the tackle at the B40; or (b) misses the tackle and then makes contact with B7 below the waist. B1 runs out of bounds at the 50.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A45. Illegal low block.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50.

A.R. 12.49 LOW BLOCK TEAM B\u2014PUNT Fourth-and-2 on A45. Team A lines up in a punt formation. After the ball is kicked, flyer A4 is blocked below the waist from the front by B4 at the 50. B1 fair catches the punt at the B14.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B7. Illegal low block by B4. The restriction on Team B begins at the snap. This is a post-possession foul.

B1 fair catches the punt at the B14.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B14. No foul. Team A\u2019s restriction against blocking low begins after the punt and the low block occurs inside the tight end box. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B29 or A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-17 on A30. Illegal low block after the punt.  Note: The restriction against blocking below the waist during a down in which there is a punt, begins after the snap for Team B, but not until after the punt for Team A.   A.R. 12.51 LOW BLOCK TEAM B\u2014BLOCKED PUNT Fourth-and-5 on 50. B1 blocks the punt which goes to the A34 where A2 attempts to recover. B2 blocks A2 below the waist from the side at the A32 just prior to B1 recovering the ball and running to the A15, where he is downed. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B35. Blocking below the waist is prohibited by the receiving team during a down in which there is a kick or change of possession. This is not a post-possession foul, because the kick did not cross the line of scrimmage, so enforcement is from the previous spot with an automatic first down.  A.R. 12.52 PUNT\u2014TEAM B PUSHING TEAMMATE INTO OPPONENT Fourth-and-20 on 50. Team A lines up a in punt formation. At the snap, B1 and B2 push down-lineman B3 into the center in an attempt to block the punt. A2\u2019s punt goes out of bounds at the B15.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B35. Team B cannot push a teammate into the offensive formation during a down in which there is a scrimmage kick formation, and it is a foul whether there is a kick or not. This is not a post-possession foul, because it is an attempt to block the kick, so enforcement is from the previous spot with an automatic first down.

Since the kick did not cross the line, it is not a post possession foul. The facemask penalty is enforced from the previous spot and is an automatic first down. If the kick had crossed and rebounded behind the line, it would be a post possession foul, and Team B would keep the ball after enforcement of its foul from the spot of the foul or the end of the kick.  A.R. 12.55 LOW BLOCK TEAM B\u2014FIELD-GOAL ATTEMPT Fourth-and-9 on B35. On an attempted field goal kicked from the B43, B2, who is lined up opposite guard A6, blocks  A6 low at the knees immediately after the snap. The kick is wide to the right.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. Team B fouls that occur immediately after the snap on field-goal attempts are considered to have happened in an attempt to block the kick and are therefore not treated as post-possession fouls; they are therefore enforced from the previous spot.

B5 intercepts a pass at the B10 and runs to the B20 where he fumbles. A3 recovers and runs the ball into the end zone for a touchdown. A4 blocked B5 below the waist from the front at the B10 during A3\u2019s run.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B25. Neither team may block below the waist after a change of possession.  A.R. 12.58 LOW BLOCK\u2014TEAM A\u2014OUTSIDE THE TIGHT END BOX\u2014PASS Second-and-10 on B45. Wide receiver A4 is flexed four yards outside tackle A5, and slot back A2 is positioned one yard to the inside of A4. Following the snap and prior to the pass, A4 hesitates as slot back A2 fires out and blocks cornerback B2 who is pressing A4. The block, which is below the waist and away from the ball, springs A4 on an inside slant route. A4 catches the pass and scores.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, second-and-25 on A40.

As A5 shows pass block, A6 blocks the defensive player in front of A5 in the area of the thigh or lower. The pass is complete to A4 for a touchdown, and: (a) A5 is the offensive tackle and A6 is the tight end; (b) A5 is the center and A6 is the left guard; or (c) A5 is the tight end and A6 is the wing back.  Rulings: In (a), (b), and (c): Second-and-20 on A45. This is an illegal \u201clure\u201d chop block. Anytime an offensive player sets up to block in a fashion that \u201clures\u201d the defender, it is a chop block when another offensive player then immediately blocks that defender below the waist. This applies to all type plays - run, pass, or kick.   A.R. 12.60 CHOP BLOCK \u2013 LURE ON RUN, PASS, KICK Second-and-10 on B40. At the snap, right tackle A2 retreats a step and sets up to block B2, who is across from him. As B2 starts forward, right guard A3 blocks B2 below the waist. A2 never makes contact with B2. This occurs (a) on a pass play, (b) on a running play, or (c) on a kick play. Team A gains a first down on the play. Rulings: (a), (b), (c): Second-and-25 on A45. Anytime an offensive player sets up to block in a fashion that \u201clures\u201d the defender, it is a chop block when another offensive player then immediately blocks that defender below the waist.

Even though a player may be attempting to gain additional yardage when he dives forward, he is intentionally going to the ground and therefore considered to be giving himself up. He is therefore down when a body part other than a hand or foot touches the ground. The ball is spotted where it was when the first body part contacted the ground.  A.R. 12.89 PLAYER WHO IS INTENTIONALLY GOING TO GROUND\u2014CONTACT BY DEFENSIVE PLAYER Third-and-5 on B45. QB A1 scrambles, and at the B43, dives in an effort to make the first down. B1 has already committed himself to tackle A1 when A1 starts to dive. B1 contacts A1 in the helmet with the forearm while A1 is still in the air. A1\u2019s knee then first hits the ground while the ball is at the B44. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B29. Personal foul by B1, hitting a defenseless player. A player who is intentionally going to the ground is a defenseless player, and the opponent must make reasonable efforts to avoid hitting him, and under no circumstances can he hit him in the head with his head, shoulder or foreman, nor can he hit him anywhere in the body with the crown of his helmet.    UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT A.R. 12.90 THROWING HELMET\u2014NOT DIRECTED AT OPPONENT OR OFFICIAL Third-and-3 on B40. B3 is unhappy with the Line Judge because he thinks he was held as A3 ran a sweep around end and was finally downed at the B35. B3 argues with the Line Judge and then throws his helmet down in disgust as he is walking back toward his bench. Ruling: First-and-10 on B20. Unsportsmanlike conduct. B3 is not disqualified for this action and it does not count toward disqualification because his action was not directed toward an opponent or an official. If he had thrown his helmet down in the vicinity of an opponent or an official, the foul would count toward disqualification. In either case, this is a foul between downs.  A.R. 12.91 THROWING HELMET\u2014PERSONAL FOUL\u2014DISQUALIFICATION Third-and-10 on B40. A2 does not like the way he was tackled by B4 at the B32, so he throws his helmet at B4. Ruling: Fourth-and-17 on B47. Personal foul by A2 plus an automatic disqualification for throwing his helmet at opponent.  A.R. 12.92 TAUNTING\u2014BY RUNNER PRIOR TO SCORE Second-and-10 on A20. A1 breaks free and is running for a touchdown ahead of all Team B players by 10 yards. When A1 gets to the B15, he turns around and holds the ball out at the trailing Team B players as A1 continues backward into the end zone.  Ruling: Touchdown Team A, and Team B has the option to enforce the taunting foul on the Try or the kickoff. Taunting fouls, whether during the play or after the dead ball, are treated as dead ball fouls. Two violations of 12-3-1 (a) through (c) in the same game results in an automatic disqualification.   A.R. 12.93 REMOVING HELMET DURING PLAY Third-and-10 on B20. With Team B ahead and the ball snapped with three seconds remaining in the game, B1 believes he has sacked QB A1 at the B35. Thinking the game is over, B1 takes his helmet off to celebrate in front of the Referee. The pass was complete to A2 who was tackled at the B10. Time expired during the play. Ruling: Game over. Removing a helmet is treated as a dead ball foul. If the score had been tied, or this was the end of the first half, the unsportsmanlike-conduct foul would be enforced against Team B on the kickoff to start overtime or the second half. (12-3-1-Penalty Enforcement) This foul does not count toward a potential disqualification.

After the prior play, the offense runs off the field, and the apparent field-goal team, including the kicker, run on. As they approach the line of scrimmage (after all 11 kicking team players had moved inside the numbers) to set in a field-goal formation, kicker A1 suddenly starts waving at A88 to get off the field, yelling that he\u2019s not supposed to be out there. A88 quickly runs off, but he stops short of the sideline and gets set on the line of scrimmage, where he is uncovered by the defense. The ball is snapped to A1 who throws a touchdown pass to A88.  Ruling: Fourth-and-25 on B40. Unsportsmanlike conduct. This is a foul at the snap and enforced as a live-ball foul. Any time a team uses a substitution or apparent substitution in an attempt to confuse the opponent, it is a foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. This is a foul inside or outside the bench area, and whether or not A88 is covered. However, if Team A had not substituted, this would be legal, because A88 was not lined up in his bench area. There is no foul if either team calls a timeout.  A.R. 12.104 HIDEOUT\u2014IN BENCH AREA Third-and-6 on B45. Split receiver A2, who was in on the previous play, lines up in front of his bench area at the B45, two yards from the sideline in an attempt to be on the field unnoticed. Team A snaps the ball and throws a quick pass to A2 who runs for a touchdown, as no defensive player saw him in front of the bench area. Team A did not substitute on the play. Ruling: Third-and-21 on A40. Illegal hideout because A2 lined up inside his team\u2019s bench area. This is a foul at the snap and enforced as a live-ball foul. This is a foul whether or not A2 is covered. It doesn\u2019t matter whether Team A substituted on the play because substitution is not an element of this foul. The spot where A2 lines up determines whether this action is illegal, not the spot from where the ball is snapped. There is no foul if either team calls a timeout.  A.R. 12.105 GOALTENDING Fourth-and-10 on B30. On an attempted field goal by A2 from the B38, B3 stands under the goal post and jumps above the crossbar and deflects (or catches) the kick so that it does not cross the crossbar. The attempt would have been successful.  Ruling: Option for Team A: Three points awarded to Team A and Kickoff A35; or first-and-10 on B15. Palpably unfair act. (12-3-1-t)  Note: If the field goal had been successful despite B3\u2019s action, it is still a foul if B3 touched the ball; the field goal would count, and A would kick off from the 50, or Team A could elect to take the points off the board, and it would be A 1-10-B15. If there was no contact with the ball, it is not a foul.   A.R. 12.106 PLAYER REMOVING HIS HELMET Third-and-10 on B20. A2 runs for a touchdown, and after scoring, removes his helmet: (a) in the end zone and turns to the crowd and glares; or (b) in the end zone, however he makes no unusual expressions and simply jogs back to his bench carrying his helmet.  Rulings:  (a) and (b): Touchdown. Unsportsmanlike Conduct. Both Team A and B have the option of enforcing fouls by their opponent on the Try or kickoff. Players are not allowed to remove their helmets on the field except in the situations designated in the Rulebook.

Punter A1 muffs the snap and is downed at the A35. B2 clips A2 after the play has ended (dead-ball foul). Upset that a foul was called, B2 pushes the Field Judge.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-25 on B35. Disqualify B2. This is not a multiple foul, because all fouls against officials are enforced as fouls between downs. Both fouls are therefore enforced, though Team B will have the ball, because both fouls occurred during the dead ball period.  A.R. 12.111 FOUL AGAINST OFFICIAL\u2014PHYSICAL CONTACT Fourth-and-2 on B35. A1 runs to the B34 where he is tackled. Immediately after he is tackled, A1 jumps up and yells at the Line Judge arguing that he was tackled by the facemask. In the process, he bumps the official. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B49. Disqualify A1. All fouls against officials are enforced, and they are enforced as fouls between downs.   A.R. 12.112 FOUL AGAINST OFFICIAL\u2014VERBAL ABUSE Second-and-2 on B25. A1 runs to the B20 where he is tackled by the facemask. A1 jumps up and yells at the Umpire, because he didn\u2019t think the foul had been called (although it had).  Ruling: First-and-goal on B25. Both fouls, unsportsmanlike conduct and facemask, are enforced, and the foul against the official is treated as a foul between downs, thus resulting in first-and-goal. Two violations of 12-3-1 (a) through (c) in the same game results in an automatic disqualification.   A.R. 12.113 LAST PLAY OF HALF\u2014FOUL AGAINST OFFICIAL Third-and-10 on B45. A1 passes to A2 at the B10 where B2 is guarding him closely. The Side Judge calls offensive pass interference. When B2 sees the flag, he thinks the foul was called on him, and he kicks the flag, or throws his helmet down, clearly to dispute the call. Time in the first half expires on the play.  Ruling: Half over. Fifteen-yard penalty enforced against Team B on the second-half kickoff. The offensive foul on the last play of the half results in the end of the half. The foul against the official is treated as a foul between downs. It therefore does not offset the pass interference, and it is enforced on the second half kickoff. B2 is not disqualified because he did not contact the official and did not throw his helmet at the official. However, a second violation of 12-3-1 (a) through (c) in the same game would result in an automatic disqualification.   A.R. 12.114 THROWING BALL AT OFFICIAL First-and-Ten on B12. Back A2 takes a handoff from QBA1 and runs for a touchdown, after which, he spikes the ball in the end zone away from players. B7 becomes upset because he felt the ball was spiked near him, and there was no flag thrown. B7 picks up the ball and deliberately throws it at the Field Judge: (a) hitting the Field Judge; or (b) missing him with the ball.  Rulings: (a) and (b) Touchdown Team A, and they have the option to enforce the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the Try or the ensuing kickoff. Disqualify B7. The player is disqualified whether or not the ball hits the official.  A.R. 12.115 TIMEOUT ON FIELD-GOAL ATTEMPT\u2014ATTEMPTING TO FREEZE KICKER Fourth-and-10 on B22.

The unsportsmanlike penalty is deemed to occur on the play as a live ball foul. (Same ruling on a Try attempt).

A.R. 12.116 FOUL DURING HALFTIME OR OVERTIME INTERMISSION As the teams are walking to the locker room at the end of the first half, or while awaiting the overtime coin toss, A1: (a) punches; or (b) taunts B1.  Rulings: (a) and (b): The 15-yard penalty will be assessed against Team A on the succeeding kickoff. A1 would also be disqualified for the punch.

A2 bats the ball in flight out of bounds at the A43.  Ruling: Fourth-and-14 on A30. Illegally batting (or kicking) the ball by the offense on a scrimmage play, (other than a scrimmage kick beyond the line), is a 10-yard penalty and a loss of down.

The penalty for an illegal bat in this situation includes a loss of down, so the Try fails and the penalty yardage is not enforced on the kickoff. (12-5-1-c)  A.R. 12.119 ILLEGAL BAT\u2014CONTROLLED PASS THROWN FORWARD Second-and-6 on B40. End A3 leaps in the air to catch a pass and controls the ball at the B35. While in the air, he flips the ball forward to A4, and: (a) A4 runs for a touchdown; or (b) A4 muffs the ball and it hits the ground. Rulings: (a) and (b): Third-and-16 on 50. A controlled pass in flight can only be thrown backward; this is an illegal bat. Enforcement is from the previous spot with a loss of down. (12-5-1-c-Note)   A.R. 12.120 ILLEGAL BAT\u2014BLOCKED PUNT\u2014TEAM B Fourth and-12 on A14. The punt is blocked and the ball rolls to the A4 where B2 bats the ball (giving it new impetus). The ball rolls over the end line.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A24. Since the punted ball did not go beyond the line of scrimmage, this is not a post-possession foul, and the illegal bat is enforced from the previous spot with an automatic first down. The result of the play is a touchback because Team B\u2019s impetus put the ball through the end zone, but enforcement of the penalty is more advantageous for Team A.  A.R. 12.121 ILLEGAL BAT\u2014PUNT\u2014BALL HITS TEAM B PLAYER Fourth-and-10 on A40. A1 bats the rolling kick at the B14 into B5 who is at the B12. The ball rebounds off B5 and goes into B\u2019s end zone where it is recovered by A3.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30, or A\u2019s ball fourth-and-20 on A30. The illegal bat results in a touchback. If the previous spot enforcement option is selected, there is no loss of down, because this occurs beyond the line of scrimmage during a scrimmage kick.  Note: The illegal bat can be enforced from the previous spot or the dead-ball spot, but since B5 is not deemed to have touched the ball, the result of the play is a touchback when the ball hits in the end zone untouched by Team B. Batting the ball creates a new impetus, so although it makes no difference on this play, the impetus that put the ball in the end zone is the bat, not the kick.   A.R. 12.122 ILLEGAL BAT\u2014END ZONE Fourth-and-10 on A2. Runner A1 fumbles at the A1. The ball goes into the Team A end zone where A2 bats it out of bounds: (a) in the end zone; (b) on the two-yard line; or (c) to A3 who recovers the ball in the end zone. Rulings: Safety in (a), (b), and (c). Safety kick A20. In (b), Team B can decline the penalty and take the result of the play, B\u2019s ball first-and-goal on A1. A player may not bat a loose ball (other than a pass in flight) in any direction in the end zone. This is a foul even if the player is attempting to keep the ball in bounds. There is no option to enforce the foul from the previous spot.  A.R. 12.123 LEGAL/ILLEGAL BAT\u2014BACKWARD PASS\u2014END ZONE INVOLVEMENT First-and-10 on A2.

A.R. 12.124 LEGAL BAT\u2014PASS IN END ZONE Second-and-goal on B6. Runner A1 runs to his right and passes the ball forward from the B7 to A2 in the end zone. A2 bats the ball forward to A3 who catches the ball in the end zone.  Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. A forward pass in flight may be batted, tipped, or deflected in any direction by any eligible player at any time.  A.R. 12.125 BAT TO PREVENT BALL FROM GOING OUT OF BOUNDS  Second-and-10 on B45. A1 runs to the B40 where he fumbles near the sideline. The ball is about to go out of bounds when B1 bats the ball toward the field of play, and B2 eventually recovers at the B35. B1 batted the ball: (a) toward Team A\u2019s goal line; or (b) toward his own goal line.  Rulings:  (a) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. This is an illegal bat, and the 10-yard penalty is enforced from the spot of the fumble.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B35. The bat was backward so it was legal.   ILLEGALLY KICKING BALL A.R. 12.126 ILLEGAL KICKING OF BALL IN POSSESSION Third-and-6 on B41. Quarterback A1 hands off to back A2 who runs to the B36. As he is being tackled, A2 stretches his arms out with the ball extending out over the B35. Prior to being down by contact, B2 kicks the ball out of A2\u2019s hands and falls on the ball.

Touchback. Decline the penalty, which would be enforced from the spot of the foul, and the down would be replayed, since the drop kick occurred beyond the line of scrimmage. A drop kick, place kick, or punt from beyond the line of scrimmage is not illegally kicking the ball and therefore does not include a loss of down.  A.R. 12.128 ILLEGAL KICKING AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION Third-and-2 on A45. B1 intercepts a pass on the B15, runs to the A35, fumbles, and then kicks the ball out of bounds at the A5 to prevent A2 from recovering.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A45. The foul is enforced from the spot of the fumble as a foul during a backward pass or fumble. There is not a loss of down, because this occurred after a change of possession.   A.R. 12.129 ILLEGAL KICKING\u2014LOOSE BALL (BACKWARD PASS)\u2014BEHIND LINE  Fourth-and-10 on A40. The snap from center is muffed, and punter A1 never controls the ball. A1 then kicks the ball while it is on the ground at the A30, and the ball rolls to the B48 where A3 falls on it.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A30. Enforce from the previous spot with a loss of down.   A.R. 12.130 ILLEGAL KICKING - PUNT BEYOND LINE Fourth-and-10 on A40. A1\u2019s punt is short and is rolling untouched at the B45. Running downfield, A1 kicks the rolling ball out of frustration, and it goes out of bounds at the B20..  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B45, or A fourth-and-20 on A30. This is a foul during a scrimmage kick, so Team B\u2019s options are to add the penalty to the end of the play, enforce it from the previous spot, or take the ball at the first touch spot. If the penalty is accepted, there is no loss of down, because this is illegal kicking beyond the line during a scrimmage kick.  A.R. 12.131 ILLEGAL KICKING\u2014FOURTH-DOWN FUMBLE\u2014BEHIND LINE Fourth-and-5 on B15. On a field-goal attempt, the snap is caught by A2 at the B23, but A2 fumbles the ball before A1 can kick the field goal. While the ball is loose on the ground, the kicker kicks the ball to prevent B2 from recovering it. The ball goes out of bounds at the B11.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B25. This is illegal kicking of a loose ball, which is enforced from the previous spot with a loss of down.  A.R. 12.132 ACCIDENTAL KICKING OF LOOSE BALL Fourth-and-12 on A14. The punt is partially blocked and the ball rolls to the A6. B1 tries to pick it up there but accidentally kicks it into the end zone where B3 falls on it. Ruling: Touchdown Team B. Kickoff B35. Only the deliberate kicking of a loose ball is a foul. Accidental kicking or batting does not create a new impetus.  RULE 13 NON-PLAYER CONDUCT A.R. 13.1 SUBSTITUTE SHOVES RUNNER AFTER HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS Second-and-5 on 50. Runner A1 goes out of bounds in the Team B bench area at the B45. Substitute B12 shoves A1 to the ground out of bounds.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. Unsportsmanlike conduct by B12. Penalize from the succeeding spot. Disqualify B12 if the action is flagrant, (but this action is not the type that counts toward a future disqualification for similar conduct). Even though there is contact, which is normally unnecessary roughness, the foul was by a player not in the game at the time, so it is penalized as unsportsmanlike conduct.

Upset when the Line Judge rules a forward pass is incomplete at the B15, A\u2019s head coach runs onto the field at the B15-yard line to calmly discuss the ruling with the Line Judge.  Ruling: Third-and-25 on B45. Unsportsmanlike conduct. Penalize 15 yards from the succeeding spot.   A.R. 13.3 HEAD COACH COMES ON FIELD TOO FAR FROM BENCH AREA Third-and-10 on B30.

The unsportsmanlike conduct penalty is enforced as a dead ball foul. If the action affected the outcome of the play in any way, the Referee will enforce a 15-yard penalty from the spot that he and the crew deem most equitable, including awarding/negating a score.   A.R. 13.6 NON-PLAYER IN SIX-FOOT BORDER\u2014CONTACT WITH PLAYER Third-and-5 on B40. On the last play of the game with the score tied and no timeouts left for either team, QBA1 hands off to A2 who runs wide and down the sideline. A2 is at the B30 when he collides with a Team B player from the bench area who is standing on his sideline. A2 fumbles and A3 recovers at the B20. A2 is injured on the play. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B15 for an untimed down (A2 could remain in the game), or the Referee may award a touchdown if he and the crew feel that is equitable.   A.R. 13.7 CONTACT WITH COACH IN SIX-FOOT BORDER First-and-10 on A30. The Side Judge is covering a long run in front of A\u2019s bench area when he runs into Team A\u2019s head coach who is standing in the six-foot, solid-white border at the 50-yard line. The Side Judge is knocked to the ground. Team A scores.  Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Team B has the option to enforce the foul on the Try or the kickoff. Unsportsmanlike conduct. The foul is enforced as a dead ball foul.

A2 runs down the sideline to the B20 where he is tackled. The Side Judge, while covering the play, is knocked to the ground by a Team B assistant in the restricted white-border area, outside the Team B bench area. During A2\u2019s run, A7 held B3 at the B30.  Ruling: Third-and-10 on A45. The dead ball unsportsmanlike conduct combines with the live ball hold to create a double foul. The fouls offset at the previous spot and the down is replayed.   A.R. 13.9 SUBSTITUTE COMES ON FIELD DURING PLAY\u2014RECOVERS FUMBLE Third-and-5 on B45. Runner A1 fumbles at the B35.

Team B has the option to enforce the 15 yard penalty on the Try or the kickoff. It is unsportsmanlike conduct for a substitute, coach or any team personnel to be out of the team bench area during the play. That penalty will be enforced on the Try or ensuing kickoff. There is no prohibition against uniformed substitutes coming onto the field to celebrate after the play, if they comply with normal celebration rules. Further, the rules against a player removing his helmet do not apply to substitutes coming off the bench. This unsportsmanlike conduct foul is not one that could lead to a disqualification.

Team B has the option to enforce the 15 yard penalty on the Try or the kickoff. It is legal for teammates who are dressed in uniform to leave the bench area to celebrate after a score, but it is a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct foul for players who are not in uniform, coaches, or other team personnel to come onto the field to celebrate. This would not be they type of foul that qualifies toward disqualification for two such fouls, unless the coach or staff member directs his actions toward an opponent.  A.R. 13.17 COACH OR TEAM STAFF MEMBER LEAVES THE TEAM BENCH AREA TO CELEBRATE AFTER TD Third-and-10 on A40. QB A1 throws a pass to A2 who catches the ball and scores a touchdown. After A2 scores, a Team A coach or team staff member runs down the sideline and celebrates with A2 in the end zone. Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Team B has the option to enforce the 15 yard penalty on the Try or the kickoff. It is unsportsmanlike conduct if any coach or team staff member leaves the bench area to participate in a celebration. This would not be they type of foul that qualifies toward disqualification for two such fouls, unless the coach or staff member directs his actions toward an opponent.

Rulings: (a) No foul. Players may help clear snow, using only their hands or feet (no towels, etc.) (b) Fourth-and-25 on B45. Unsportsmanlike conduct. It is impermissible for the grounds crew or other team personnel to clear away snow for a Try, field goal, punt, or kickoff.

B1 returns the interception to the A35 where: (a) B1 is tackled, or (b) B1 fumbles and A3 recovers at the A30. Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A20. Chop block. The chop block is tacked on from the dead ball spot.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A35. Chop block. The chop block is enforced from the spot of the interception.  A.R. 14.21 PERSONAL FOUL BEFORE OR AFTER INTERCEPTION\u2014TOUCHBACK Second-and-10 on B25. A1\u2019s pass is intercepted by B1 in the end zone where B1 is tackled.

The chop block is enforced from the dead-ball spot.  A.R. 14.23 INTENTIONAL GROUNDING\u2014EXCEPTION TO HALF THE DISTANCE ENFORCEMENT Third-and-5 on A10. Quarterback A1 is called for intentional grounding on the A4. Ruling: Fourth-and-11 on A4. Intentional grounding. If the spot of the foul is more than half the distance, the enforcement is to put the ball at the spot of the foul.  A.R. 14.24 INTENTIONAL GROUNDING\u2014HALF-DISTANCE ENFORCEMENT Third-and-5 on A10. Quarterback A1 is called for intentional grounding on the A6. Ruling: Fourth-and-10 on A5. Intentional grounding.

A.R. 14.25 ILLEGAL FORWARD PASS BEYOND LINE\u2014TEAM A PERSONAL FOUL Third-and-15 on A30. Quarterback A1 scrambles to the A32 where he throws a forward pass to A2 at the B20. The pass is underthrown, and B1 is in position to intercept the pass, when A2 grabs and twists B2\u2019s facemask while the pass is in the air. The pass falls incomplete. Ruling: Fourth-and-18 at the A27 or 3-28-A17. If the illegal forward pass foul is enforced, it is a five-yard penalty from the spot of the pass, and a loss of down. If the personal foul facemask is enforced, it is from the end of the run, as this is deemed to be a running play. Pass interference is not an option, since the pass was thrown from beyond the line of scrimmage.

Tackle A3 enters the game, goes into the huddle without reporting, and takes a wingback position in a punt formation. After the punt, B1 muffs the ball on the B30 and A2 recovers it there. B2 was offside.  Ruling: Fourth-and-10 on A30. Illegal formation by Team A for a player wearing an ineligible number playing an eligible position without reporting. Also, defensive offside. The penalties offset.  A.R. 14.31 FIRST TOUCH\u2014TEAM B FOUL\u2014DURING KICK/RETURN Fourth-and-6 on A40. A1 is the first to touch the punt on the B24. B1 recovers at the B18 and runs to the B30. B2 held on the B45: (a) during the punt; or (b) during the run by B1. Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B9. Offensive holding. The post-possession foul is enforced from the end of the kick, because that is behind the spot of B\u2019s foul. The enforcement of B\u2019s foul negates the first touch.   (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. Offensive holding. The penalty is enforced from the dead-ball spot, since the foul occurred during the run, and the run ended behind the spot of the foul.  A.R. 14.32 FIRST TOUCH\u2014TEAM B FOUL\u2014OFFSIDE/PUSHING TEAMMATE Fourth-and-10 on A45. A1 first touches and downs the punt on the B10: (a) B1 was offside; or (b) B2 pushed his teammate from behind into the right guard at the snap.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B10, if Team A declines the defense offside; or A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-5 on 50.  (b) A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B40. Unnecessary roughness for pushing a teammate into the offensive formation on a scrimmage kick or Try. This foul is enforced from the previous spot.   A.R. 14.33 FIRST TOUCH\u2014TEAM B FOUL\u2014DURING PUNT/RETURN\u2014FUMBLE Fourth-and-15 on A10. A3 first touches the punt at the 50. B1 recovers at the B40 and fumbles at the A35, where A2 recovers. B2 held on the A30: (a) during the punt; or (b) during the run by B1. Rulings:  (a) A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-5 on A20.

The holding penalty is therefore enforced from the previous spot, and with the enforcement of a foul, the first touch violation is eliminated.

During A2\u2019s run, B2 grabbed and twisted A2\u2019s facemask on the B6: (a) before; or (b) after A2 crossed the goal line.  Rulings:  (a) Touchdown Team A. Team A has the option to enforce the foul on the Try or the kickoff. When A accepts the live ball foul, the first touching violation is negated by the foul.

A1 punts the ball, and B1 gives an invalid fair-catch signal at the B20. B1 is in position to catch the ball when it hits A2 in the air at the B21. B1 then picks up the ball at the B15 and runs to the B40 where he fumbles and A2 recovers.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-10 on A40. Invalid fair catch signal and interference with the opportunity to catch a kick. Since Team B did not retain possession, the fouls offset and the down is replayed.   A.R. 14.37 DOUBLE FOUL WITH A CHANGE\u2014INVALID FAIR CATCH SIGNAL/KICK CATCH INTERFERENCE Fourth-and-10 on 50. B1 gives an invalid fair-catch signal as he waits to catch the punt at the B20. A1 bumps B1 before the punted ball arrives, but B1 catches the ball anyway at the B20.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B15, or Team B has the option to replay.

The punt rolls out of bounds in the end zone. During the punt, there is a foul by B1 at the B12. The foul is: (a) clipping by B1 at the B12; or (b) blocking by B1 at the B12 after giving a fair-catch signal at the B14. Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B6. Clipping. Since the foul was inside the B20, it is enforced from the spot of the foul. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B6. Blocking after giving a fair catch signal is a spot foul.   A.R. 14.39 TEAM B FOUL DURING PUNT\u2014KICK ENDS IN END ZONE Fourth-and-10 on 50. During the punt, B1 commits an illegal block in the back at the B40. B2 catches the punt in the end zone and returns it to the 50 where he is tackled.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B10. Illegal block in the back. Since the kick ended in the end zone, the foul is enforced from the end of the kick (B20), as that is behind the spot of the foul.  A.R. 14.40 TEAM B FOUL IN END ZONE DURING PUNT Fourth-and-10 on 50. During the punt, B1 clips A2 in the end zone. The punt goes out of bounds at the B6. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B3. Clipping. This is not a safety because Team B did not run with the ball. When a post-possession foul occurs in the endzone, it is deemed to have occurred at the 20-yard line if Team A is responsible for the ball entering Team B\u2019s end zone.

A1\u2019s punt is blocked, and A1 kicks the rolling ball off the ground: (a) at the A2; or (b) from three yards deep in the end zone. The ball goes out of bounds at the A25.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-goal on A5. Illegally kicking a loose ball. Since the penalty occurred behind the line of scrimmage, in the field of play, it is enforced from the previous spot, with a loss of down.

During the loose ball, A2 grabs and twists B2\u2019s facemask in the end zone. A1 then recovers the fumble: (a) at the A4; or (b) in the end zone. Rulings:  (a) Safety. Safety kick A20. The facemask occurred in the end zone, but the dead ball spot was in the field of play. Therefore, the foul is \u201cused\u201d to get the safety, so it cannot be tacked on at the spot of the safety kick. (14-2-2-b) (b) Safety. Safety kick A10.

Since both fouls were dead ball fouls after the play, there is no 5 vs.15 enforcement and the fouls offset at the dead ball spot.  NOTE: 5 vs.15 enforcement does apply to fouls after the ready for play and before the snap, but 5 vs.15 enforcement does not apply if the 5-yard and 15 yard penalties occur after the play ends and before the next ready for play.   A.R. 14.55 MULTIPLE AND DOUBLE FOULS Third-and-3 on A28. A1 is illegally in motion at the snap. Team A has six men on the line of scrimmage. A3 runs to the A40 where he is tackled by the facemask by B3. B4 was offside at the snap.  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A43. Team A, illegal motion and illegal formation; Team B, offside and personal foul facemask. 5 vs. 15 enforcement applies if there is at least one 15-yard penalty by one team, and one or more simple 5\u2019s by the other team.   A.R. 14.56 DOUBLE FOUL Second-and-10 at A40. End A3 is legally chucked out of bounds at the A43. A3 immediately re-establishes at the A48 and leaps in an attempt to catch the pass. The pass goes off of A3\u2019s fingers and, while A3 is defenseless, B3 launches and hits A3 helmet-to-helmet as the pass falls incomplete.  Ruling: Second-and-10 on A40. Illegal touch of a forward pass and unnecessary roughness. Illegal touching of a forward pass by an eligible receiver who has been out of bounds is not a five-yard penalty, (loss of down only, so not a simple 5), so 5 vs. 15 enforcement does not apply. The penalties offset and the down is replayed.   A.R. 14.57 DOUBLE DEAD BALL FOULS\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Second-and-10 on B30. One minute and twenty-five seconds remain in the game, and Team B is ahead 17-14. The clock is running, and Team A hurries to the ball, but A3 false starts. B1 comes across the line and body slams A1. Ruling: Second-and-10 on B30. False start and unnecessary roughness. There is no 5 vs. 15 enforcement, because the false start is not a \u201csimple 5\u201d due to the 10-second runoff portion of the foul. However, in this situation, since the penalties offset, there is no 10-second runoff, and the clock starts on the snap.  A.R. 14.58 DOUBLE DEAD BALL FOULS\u2014AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING Second-and-10 on B30. One minute and twenty-five seconds remain in the game, and Team A is ahead 17-14 with the clock running. Team A comes to the line, and B2 encroaches by making contact with Guard A2. A2 takes exception and body slams B2. Ruling: Second-and-10 on B30. Encroachment and unnecessary roughness. There is no 5 vs. 15 enforcement because the encroachment is not a \u201csimple 5\u201d, as this foul would require the play clock to be set to 40 seconds. However, in this situation, since there is a double foul, the play clock is set to 25 seconds, and the clock starts on the snap.  A.R. 14.59 TEAM B LIVE BALL PERSONAL FOUL\u2014TEAM A DELAY OF GAME AT END OF PLAY Second-and-10 on A20. During A2\u2019s run, B1 grabs center A3\u2019s mask and pulls him to the ground. A2 runs to the (a) 50; or (b) A37. In celebration, A2 (while still on the ground, or after getting up) forcibly spikes the ball away from players in the field of play.

During A2\u2019s run, B1 grabs center A3\u2019s mask and pulls him to the ground. A2 runs to the (a) 50; or (b) A37. In celebration, A2 (while still on the ground, or after getting up) forcibly spikes the ball away from players in the field of play.  Rulings:  (a) First-and-10 on A45. Facemask and delay of game. Team A has the option to decline the foul by B1 (which would be 5 vs. 15 enforcement, here) and allow their delay-of-game penalty to be enforced from the dead ball spot.  (b) First-and-10 on A35. Facemask and delay-of-game. Team A\u2019s better option here is to accept 5 vs.15 enforcement. (14-5-1-Item 1.)  Note: When there is a double foul, and Team A\u2019s only foul is a dead ball spike delay-of- game at the end of the play, Team A has the option whether to accept normal double foul enforcement, (replay the down, or 5 vs. 15 enforcement, if appropriate), or instead decline Team B\u2019s foul and just have their dead ball spike delay-of-game penalty enforced.

A2 then grabs B1\u2019s facemask and pulls him off the pile to allow A1 to get up.  Ruling: First-and-10 on B20. Delay of game defense and unnecessary roughness offense. Dead-ball fouls by both  teams offset at the succeeding spot. There is no 5 vs. 15 enforcement for dead-ball fouls at the end of a play. The clock starts on the snap.

Defense offside and dead ball unsportsmanlike conduct. Both fouls are enforced separately as the unsportsmanlike foul against an official is treated as a foul between downs. (It also counts toward a disqualification for two such qualifying fouls in the game.)  Note: If the official had flagged A2 for simply taking his helmet off (rather than arguing with an official), the unsportsmanlike conduct foul would combine with the offside penalty to create a 5/15 enforcement.   A.R. 14.63 TEAM A SIGNALS FOR TIMEOUT WHEN NOT PERMITTED\u2014PLAY IS RUN\u2014TEAM B PERSONAL FOUL Second-and-12 on B40. Team A is out of timeouts, but after all 11 players get set, A1 turns and asks the Referee for a timeout. The Referee ignores the request. A1 gets set again and takes the snap. He hands off to back A2 who runs out of bounds at the B36 where B2 hits him late.  Ruling: First-and-10 on B21. Unnecessary roughness. There is no foul for delay of game, since the officials did not grant A1\u2019s request. The late hit is enforced per normal rules.   A.R. 14.64 TEAM A SIGNALS FOR TIMEOUT WHEN NOT PERMITTED\u2014GRANTED\u2014TEAM B PERSONAL FOUL Second-and-12 on B40. Team A is out of timeouts, but after all 11 players get set, A1 turns and asks the Referee for a timeout who incorrectly grants it. Immediately following the whistle, B4 knocks center A8 to the ground.  Ruling: First-and-10 on B25. Delay of game and unnecessary roughness. When the officials grant a timeout request from a team that is not legally permitted to take one, it is a penalty for delay of game. The unnecessary roughness by B4 combines with the delay of game to create a 5 vs.15 enforcement. If this occurred after the two-minute warning, with the clock running, the delay of game would not be a simple 5 because it would include a ten-second runoff. In that case, the fouls would offset at the previous spot.  FOULS PRIOR TO A CHANGE OF POSSESSION A.R. 14.65 FOUL PRIOR TO FUMBLE\u2014DOUBLE CHANGE OF POSSESSION Fourth-and-10 on A40.

Receiver B2 catches the ball in the end zone and runs it back to the A35. On the runback, B3 blocks low on the A26. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50 or Rekick A35. This is a double foul with a change of possession, A3 offside, and B3 illegally blocking below the waist. Team B would likely decline the offside foul and have their low block foul enforced from the dead ball spot, since the low block occurred in advance of that spot.   A.R. 14.72 KICKOFF\u2014DOUBLE FOUL\u2014KICKOFF OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014TEAM B LOW BLOCK DURING KICK A\u2019s kickoff from the A35 rolls out of bounds on the B10 after last touching A1. B1 had blocked A2 low at the B15 before the kickoff went out of bounds.  Ruling: Rekick A35. Kickoff out of bounds and an illegal low block. Since both fouls happened during the kick, the fouls offset and there must be a rekick.  A.R. 14.73 KICKOFF\u2014DOUBLE FOUL\u2014TEAM B FOUL IN FIELD OF PLAY/END ZONE AFTER CHANGE  A1 is offside on the kickoff from the A35. B1 catches the ball in end zone and runs to B15. During the run, B2 clips: (a) on B6; or (b) in B\u2019s end zone.  Rulings:  (a) Re-kick A35, or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B3. Offside and Clipping. (b) Re-kick A35. This is a double foul with a change of possession, and since the enforcement of B2\u2019s foul would be a safety, the down is replayed.   A.R. 14.74 KICKOFF OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014DEAD-BALL FOUL BY TEAM B Kickoff from the A35, and after the ball goes out of bounds untouched at the B20, B1 knocks down A2 from behind. Ruling: Rekick A35, or B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B10. Kickoff out of bounds and personal foul unnecessary roughness. This is a double foul with a change of possession, so A\u2019s foul would be declined, and enforcement of B\u2019s foul would be from the dead ball spot. Team B would therefore likely choose to replay the down.  A.R. 14.75 PUNT\u2014TEAM A FOULS DURING PUNT\u2014TEAM B FOULS AFTER SCORING Fourth-and-5 on A28. A1: (a) holds; or (b) clips prior to a punt. B1 catches the kick at the B30 and runs for a touchdown. B2 clips after B1 scores.  Rulings:  (a) Touchdown Team B. Clean hands score. Team A has the option to enforce the clipping foul on the Try or the kickoff. Team A\u2019s offensive holding is declined. If Team A chooses to enforce the penalty on the Try, Team B has the option to choose from which Try spot the penalty will be enforced. (b) Touchdown Team B. Kickoff B35. Clean hands score. Team A\u2019s major foul will bridge, and the double fouls automatically offset at the succeeding spot; there are no enforcement options for either team.   A.R. 14.76 PUNT\u2014BOTH TEAMS FOUL PRIOR TO THE KICK\u2014KICK IS BLOCKED Fourth-and-10 on 50. At the snap, A5 grabs and twists B5\u2019s facemask. B1 was offside and gets through to block the punt. The ball is recovered at the A45 by: (a) A2; or (b) B2.  Rulings:  (a) Fourth-and-10 on 50. Facemask and defense offside.

A1\u2019s pass is intercepted by B1, and during the interception return, A2 grabs and twists B1\u2019s facemask at the B25, which causes B1 to fumble the ball at the B30. During the fumble, B2 blocks low at the B35. B1 then recovers the ball at the B40. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. This is a double foul after a change of possession, (the interception), so the fouls offset at the spot where Team B\u2019s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. Since B2\u2019s low block occurred during a loose ball, these fouls offset at the spot of the fumble, as that is behind the spot of the foul. Had Team A recovered the fumble, this would be a double foul with a double change of possession, and the down would be replayed, because Team A did not get the ball with clean hands.  A.R. 14.81 PUNT\u2014DOUBLE FOUL AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION Fourth-and-7 on A22. A2 punts the ball to B1 who catches the punt at the B35. B1 is tackled by the facemask at the 50. During the return, B5 clips at the: (a) B40 or (b) A45.  Rulings:   (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B40. The fouls offset at the spot where Team B\u2019s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul, which is the spot of Team B\u2019s foul here, because that is less advantageous to Team B than the dead ball spot. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and 10 on the 50. The fouls offset at the spot where Team B\u2019s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul, which is the dead ball spot here, because that is less advantageous to Team B than the spot of B5\u2019s foul.   Note: When Team B\u2019s foul is not a post possession foul, the end of the kick is irrelevant for enforcement purposes on a double foul after a change of possession.   A.R. 14.82 PUNT\u2014DOUBLE FOUL AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION Fourth-and-10 on 50. During A1\u2019s punt, B1 commits an illegal block in the back at the B20. B2 catches the punt at the B10 and returns it to the B40, where A1 tackles B2 by the facemask.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 at B10. The double/after enforcement spot is the spot where Team B\u2019s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. Since B\u2019s foul is a post possession foul, the enforcement spot is either the end of the kick or the spot of B\u2019s foul. The illegal block above the waist and the facemask therefore offset at the end of the kick, as that is the least advantageous spot for Team B.  A.R. 14.83 PUNT\u2014KICK ENDS IN END ZONE\u2014DOUBLE FOUL AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION Fourth-and-6 on B38. During A1\u2019s punt, B2 blocks A2 low at the B18. The ball lands at the B8, B3 muffs the ball at the B6, and it rolls into the end zone. B2 recovers the ball and runs to the B31 where A8 tackles him by the facemask.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B18. Since B\u2019s foul on this double/after play is a post possession foul, B\u2019s low block and A\u2019s facemask offset at the end of the kick, or the spot of B\u2019s foul, whichever is least advantageous to Team B. Since the end of the kick is the end zone and would result in a touchback, the end of the kick is deemed to be the B20. The spot of B\u2019s foul at the B18 is therefore used as the enforcement spot.   A.R. 14.84 INVALID FAIR-CATCH SIGNAL\u2014LEGAL/LATE HIT ON SIGNALLER Fourth-and-8 on A40.

Since the end of the kick is the end zone and would result in a touchback, the end of the kick is deemed to be the B20.

B1 gives an invalid fair-catch signal at the B15 and catches the ball at the B17: (a) A3 tackles  B1 at the B17; or (b) A3 strikes B1 in the head after he makes the catch at B17.

Double foul after a change of possession. The invalid fair catch signal and unnecessary roughness offset at the B15, because Team B\u2019s foul is a spot foul, so that would be the enforcement spot for B1\u2019s foul, if that was the only foul on the play.   A.R. 14.85 PUNT\u2014LIVE-BALL AND DEAD-BALL FOULS\u2014DOUBLE FOUL AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION Fourth-and-14 on A31. A1\u2019s punt is fielded by B3 at the B15 and returned to the B23. During the punt, B4 holds A5 at the B20. Immediately after the ball is dead at the B23, a scuffle ensues, and A7 hits B7 in the facemask. Unnecessary roughness is called.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B15. The live ball offensive holding by B4 is a post-possession foul, so it is treated as happening after the change of possession. It combines with the dead ball unnecessary roughness foul by A7, creating a double foul after a change of possession. The penalties therefore offset at the spot where B4\u2019s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul - the spot of B\u2019s foul or the end of the kick, whichever is least advantageous to Team B.  A.R. 14.86 PUNT\u2014TEAM B SCORES\u2014DOUBLE FOUL AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION Fourth-and-10 on A7. The punt is partially blocked, and B1 recovers on the A22 and runs for a touchdown. Prior to the score, B2 holds in A\u2019s end zone. After the score, A3 grabs B1\u2019s facemask and throws him to the ground. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A1. The live ball offensive holding by B2, combines with the dead ball unnecessary roughness foul by A3, and the penalties offset at the A1. Since the spot of B\u2019s foul and the dead ball spot are both in A\u2019s end zone, the enforcement of B2\u2019s foul would be from the goal line, if that was the only foul; the ball is therefore spotted on the 1-yard line.", "start_char_idx": 2771, "end_char_idx": 5330, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f298ac34-8177-4836-ac7a-6188f71a37dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "f298ac34-8177-4836-ac7a-6188f71a37dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4de8dee6-ad50-4246-a4bc-2becba25b51c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "16e20af50cac3758f8aafe27cf0d9a8b6f7ac21ac289bc35b5eb0a63510516b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a980855e-a459-43eb-8acd-1a09ab85a55c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "199", "file_name": "2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\jackp\\PycharmProjects\\llama-example\\data\\2022-nfl-rulebook-final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6685302, "creation_date": "2024-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-29"}, "hash": "573ac0f3d2f55245543d6a583139f50b730c7830fdbb0d4d7e315b87e5784257", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d71d60a-0715-4d46-a8b8-04f43a161ebc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3f572a1b543b781201ac2e2a3d09f3efa31fe2bebda8127b627f504bcf11fea3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "104 A.R. 14.87 INTERCEPTION\u2014MOMENTUM\u2014DOUBLE FOUL AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION Second-and-6 on B14. B1 intercepts the pass on the B2, and momentum carries him into the end zone where he attempts to advance. A1 trips B1 which causes B1 to go to the ground in the end zone. B2 grabs and twists A1\u2019s facemask after B1 is down.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B2. The tripping and unnecessary roughness offset at the spot where B2\u2019s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. Here, that would be the spot of B\u2019s foul or the dead ball spot, whichever is least advantageous to Team B. Due to the momentum play, the dead-ball spot is the B2, and since B\u2019s foul was a dead ball foul, its enforcement spot would be the dead-ball spot, the B2.   A.R. 14.88 INTERCEPTION\u2014END ZONE\u2014DOUBLE FOUL AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION Third-and-5 on B22. B1 intercepts a pass in B\u2019s end zone and attempts to run the ball out, but during the run, B2 holds in the end zone where B1 is downed. A3 piles on B1 after the tackle.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B1. The offensive holding and dead ball unnecessary roughness offset at the spot where Team B\u2019s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. Here, since the result of the play is a touchback, the dead ball spot is deemed to be the B20. However, B\u2019s foul is behind that spot, and since B fouls in the end zone and runs with the ball, the enforcement of B\u2019s live ball foul in the end zone would be a safety. The fouls therefore offset at the B1.  A.R. 14.89 INTERCEPTION\u2014END ZONE\u2014DOUBLE FOUL AFTER CHANGE OF POSSESSION Second-and-10 on B30. B1 intercepts the ball in the end zone, runs, and is tackled in the end zone. During the run, B2 clips at the B7, and A2 tackles B1 by the facemask. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B7. Since the result of the play was a touchback, the dead ball spot is deemed to be the B20, (or B25 if on a free kick). The spot of B\u2019s foul was behind that spot, so the fouls offset at the spot of B\u2019s foul.   A.R. 14.90 INTERCEPTION\u2014END ZONE\u2014DOUBLE FOUL WITH/AFTER CHANGE  Third-and-Five on B15. B1 intercepts A1's pass in the end zone, tries to run it out, but is tackled in the end zone. During B1's run: (a) B2 pulled A7 down by the facemask at the B3, and A8 grabbed and twisted B1\u2019s facemask in the end zone. Back A4 was illegally in motion at the snap; (b) B6 blocked A6 low at the B4. Team A had six players on the line of scrimmage at the snap; (c) B5 clipped A5 at the B4, and B5 was upset with the call, so he threw the Field Judge\u2019s flag into the air.  Rulings: (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B3. The double foul after the change takes precedence over the double foul with a change.

The punt is rolling on the ground at the B4 when B1 bats the loose ball backward into his end zone, thinking he can create a touchback.

A3 then piles on.  Rulings:  (a) Fourth-and-10 on A43. Replay the down. This is a double foul with a change of possession, because A7\u2019s foul is before the change, and B2\u2019s foul is post possession, thus treated as after the change. Since Team B\u2019s impetus put the ball in the end zone, and B then fouled there, the enforcement of B2\u2019s foul would create a safety; therefore, by rule, the down is replayed. (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B1. This is a double foul after a change of possession. Team B\u2019s impetus, (bat), put the ball in the end zone, after which both teams fouled in the end zone. Team B\u2019s foul would be enforced from the end zone resulting in a safety, if it was the only foul. The fouls therefore offset at the B1. (c) Safety, safety kick B20. This is a clean hands score. The bat is legal, but it creates new impetus, resulting in a safety when B downs the ball in its end zone. Team A has clean hands at the time of the score, so the score counts, and A7\u2019s personal foul is enforced on the safety kick.

Illegal motion by A1, and the pass is intercepted by B1 at the B20. On the return, B2 commits an illegal block in the back at the B30, and A2 tackles B1 by the facemask at the B40.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. Illegal motion prior to the interception, followed by an illegal block in the back and a personal foul facemask. The double foul after a change takes precedence over the double foul with a change, and the fouls offset at the spot of B\u2019s foul, as that is behind the dead ball spot and would be the enforcement spot if the only foul was B\u2019s foul.

Team B catches the ball at the B15, and during the return, B2 clips at the B45 and is tackled at the B37. A1 piles on.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B37, or Team B has the option to replay the down. The double foul after a change takes precedence over the double foul with a change, so the fouls offset at the spot where Team B\u2019s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. On this play, that is the dead ball spot, which is behind the spot of B\u2019s foul. Since this is a kicking play, and there is also a double foul with a change, Team B also has the option to require a rekick from the A35.  A.R. 14.95 KICKOFF OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014DEAD-BALL FOULS BY BOTH TEAMS Kickoff from the A35 goes out of bounds at the B24, after which A1 and B2 commit dead-ball fouls. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B24, or Team B has the option to replay the down. This is a double foul with a change and a double foul after a change. The double after takes precedence and is enforced from the spot where B\u2019s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. Here, that is the dead-ball spot, which is also the spot of the foul. Since there is also a foul by Team A before the change of possession creating a double foul with a change on a kicking play, Team B also has the option to require a rekick from the A35.

B1 intercepts A1's pass in the end zone, tries to run it out, but is tackled in the end zone. A4 was illegally in motion at the snap. During B1's run, (a) B6 blocked A6 low at the B4; or (b) B2 pulled A7 down by the facemask at the B3, and A8 grabbed and twisted B1\u2019s facemask in the end zone.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B2. Double foul with a change. By rule, the illegal formation prior to the change is declined, and B\u2019s low block is enforced from the spot of the foul, since it occurred inside the B20 (which is deemed to be the dead ball spot).  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B3. The double foul after a change takes precedence over the double foul with a change, so A\u2019s illegal motion penalty is declined by rule.

Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on 50. Illegal motion and defense offside prior to the interception, and clipping by B5 during the return.

B1 is downed in the end zone or field of play.  Ruling: Safety. Safety kick B20. Since Team A\u2019s impetus put the ball in the end zone, the result of the play is not a safety. The foul that occurred in the end zone during B1\u2019s run is used to create the safety, so no yardage is enforced on the safety kick.

B2 clips at the B10 while the punt is in the air. The ball rolls out of bounds at the B16. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B5. The clipping foul is enforced from the spot of the foul, since it was behind the end of the kick.   A.R. 14.113 PUNT\u2014FIRST TOUCH\u2014TEAM B FOUL IN END ZONE Fourth-and-5 on A40. A1 first touches the punt on B10. B1 picks up ball at the B7 and runs to B20. B2 held A2 in Team B end zone during the run by B1. Ruling: Safety. Safety kick B20. Since the holding penalty occurred in the end zone, and B ran with the ball, the enforcement results in a safety. The enforcement of the penalty eliminates the first touch.  A.R. 14.114 MISSED FIELD GOAL\u2014TEAM B FOUL DURING KICK Fourth-and-8 on B22. A field goal attempt from the B30 is blocked at the B28, and the ball bounces to the B12 where it rolls out of bounds. Before the ball went out of bounds, B3 clipped A2 at the B15. Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B6. The clipping foul is clearly not committed in an attempt to block the kick, so it is a post-possession foul enforced from the end of the kick.  A.R. 14.115 MISSED FIELD GOAL\u2014TEAM B FOUL DURING KICK Fourth-and-8 on B22. A field goal attempt from the B30 is blocked at the B28, and the ball rolls out of bounds in B\u2019s end zone. Before the ball went out of bounds, B3 clipped A2 at the B16.  Ruling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B8. The clipping foul is a post possession foul enforced from the spot of the foul. On a field-goal attempt, if Team B touches the kick anywhere beyond the line of scrimmage, if a Team B foul on the play is accepted, or if the kick is recovered by either team behind the line of scrimmage, Team B loses the option to go back to the spot of the kick (or the 20-yard line).   SCORING PLAYS A.R. 14.116 TOUCHDOWN\u2014DEAD-BALL FOUL First-and-10 on 50. Runner A1 crosses B\u2019s goal line after which: (a) A2 commits a personal foul; or (b) B1 commits a personal foul.

Team A has the option to enforce the personal foul on the Try or the kickoff.  A.R. 14.117 INTERCEPTION\u2014TEAM B FOUL BEFORE AND AFTER TOUCHDOWN First-and-10 on 50. B1 intercepts a pass at the B20 and runs for a touchdown. B2 clipped in A\u2019s end zone: (a) before; or (b) after B1 crossed the goal line.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A15. The clipping foul is enforced from the goal line.   (b) Touchdown B. Team A has the option to enforce the clipping penalty on the Try or the kickoff.

Enforce the ineligible downfield foul from the previous spot. The taunting must be declined, or the score would count. This taunting foul still counts toward a potential disqualification, even though it has been declined.  A.R. 14.120 TOUCHDOWN ON LAST PLAY OF GAME Second-and-4 on B30. With 6 seconds left in the game, Team A trails 24-15. A1\u2019s pass is caught by A4 for a touchdown, and the game clock expires on the play.  Ruling: Game over Team B wins 24-21.

B1 grabs and twists runner A1\u2019s facemask, but A1 continues and scores a touchdown. Immediately after A1 crosses the goal line, B2 grabs A1\u2019s facemask and pulls him to the ground.

B1 picks up the ball and runs for a touchdown. Well after B1 has crossed the goal line, as B1 is running toward his bench, A1 grabs and pulls B1 by the facemask. Ruling: Touchdown Team B. The KCI can be enforced on the Try or on the kickoff because of the score by Team B. The unnecessary roughness foul is a foul between downs, so that can also be enforced on the Try or on the kickoff.

Quarterback A1 is piled on by B2 after running out of bounds at the B30, after which: (a) A2 roughs B1; or (b) B1 roughs A2.  Rulings:  (a) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B30. The dead-ball fouls offset at the succeeding spot.  (b) B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B15. Multiple dead-ball fouls (14-1-3).

A2 is illegally in motion at the snap, and A1 is sacked in his own end zone. After the ball is dead, B1 piles on.  Ruling: Safety. Safety kick on A35. Team B scored with clean hands, so the Team A foul is declined, and the Team B foul is enforced on the safety kick.  A.R. 14.136 SAFETY\u2014DEAD-BALL FOUL BY TEAM B Fourth-and-15 on A2.

The score is tied on the last play of the half. A\u2019s field-goal attempt is blocked and the ball rolls to the B28. Kicker A2 picks up the ball, runs to the B19, and throws a pass to eligible A6 at the B15. A6 catches the pass at the B15, runs to the B5, fumbles, and: (a) A8 recovers at the B2 and scores; or (b) A6 recovers his fumble at the B4 and B8 piles on him after he is tackled.

Immediately after A1 is down, A3 screams in the face of the Down Judge that A1 was tackled by the facemask, and then A2 shoves the official. Ruling: Fourth-and-35 on A35. Disqualify A2. Both unsportsmanlike conduct fouls are enforced in this situation, as a foul against an official is always enforced as a foul between downs.

B1 commits pass interference at the B28. Right after the play, B1 is angry about the foul and throws his helmet down at the ground in the direction of the official. Ruling: First-and-10 on B14. Disqualify B1. The foul against the official is treated as a foul between downs, so both the defensive pass interference and unsportsmanlike conduct are enforced.

A1 passes complete to A3 at the B30 and he is tackled either inbounds or out of bounds, after which B2 piles on.  Ruling: Second-and-10 on B40. Replay the down. The offensive holding and dead ball personal foul offset.  Note: Live ball fouls combine with dead-ball fouls to create double fouls.   A.R. 14.146 DOUBLE FOUL\u2014TEAM B LIVE BALL FOUL\u2014DEAD BALL FOULS BY BOTH TEAMS First-and-Ten on A20. Back A2 takes a handoff and runs to the B20 where he is tackled. During A2's run, B6 pulls A6\u2019s facemask at the B10. After the play, A2 shoves B4 and B4 shoves A2 (both actions are unnecessary roughness).  Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A20. Replay the down. The live ball facemask combines with the dead ball personal foul to create a double foul.

A3 is illegally downfield. The pass is completed to A2 who either runs out of bounds or is tackled inbounds at the B30. As the referee begins his announcement for the ineligible receiver downfield, A2 taunts B1. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, first-and-30 on A30. The ineligible receiver downfield is enforced, and the significant delay after the play ends and before the dead-ball taunting, permits both fouls to be enforced.

As quarterback A1 drops back to pass, A2 holds B1 at the line of scrimmage. A1 subsequently completes a pass to A3 in the end zone for a touchdown. Running back A4, in his excitement, runs into the end zone to congratulate A3 and takes off his helmet in the process. The Field Judge throws a flag for UNS.  Ruling: Third-and-15 on B20. Team B must accept the offensive holding and decline the unsportsmanlike conduct to negate the touchdown.

Ruling: Unsportsmanlike conduct fouls between halves, or between the end of the regulation game and overtime, are assessed on the kickoff at the start of the second half or overtime. Disqualify the coach or player involved, if appropriate.   A.R. 14.154 FAILURE TO MAKE LINE TO GAIN ON THIRD DOWN\u2014TEAM A PLAYER PUNCHES OPPONENT Third-and-10 on A10. A1 is downed on A16. During the run, A2 punches B1 at the A12.  Ruling: Fourth-and-4 on A16, or third-and-14 on A6. Disqualify A2. A2 is disqualified regardless of whether the unnecessary roughness penalty is accepted or declined.    A.R. 14.155 TOUCHDOWN\u2014ENFORCEMENT OF MAJOR FOULS BY BOTH TEAMS Third-and-10 on A30. While A1 is running with the ball at the B25, B1 grabs and pulls his facemask. A1 scores on the play. (a) After A1 crosses the goal line, A1 shoves B1, knocking him to the ground; (b) well after A1 has crossed the goal line, and as A1 is running toward his bench, A1 shoves B1, knocking him to the ground; (c) after Team A has elected to enforce B1\u2019s facemask on the kickoff, but before the ready for play for the Try, A1 shoves B1, knocking him to the ground; or (d) after Team A has elected to enforce B1\u2019s facemask on the kickoff, and after the ready for play for the Try, A1 shoves B1, knocking him to the ground Rulings: (a) These fouls happened on the play and in the continuing action after the play, so they offset on the kickoff, and neither team has the option to enforce on the Try.

first, and whether the ball was touched before it went out of bounds), whether the ball hit a boundary line, pylon, or the ground, the recovery of a free kick, and momentum/touchback. Formations are not reviewable. Once the kick is possessed, it becomes a running play, and those guidelines apply. When on-field officials award possession to the kicking team at the end of any free kick down, including when that ruling is negated by a foul, it is an automatic Replay Official review.  ILLEGAL TOUCHING A.R. 15.1 Illegal touch after being out of bounds  On a kickoff from the A35, the ball is rolling loose at the sideline at the B40. A1 goes out of bounds, re-establishes, and is the first to touch at the B40 where he recovers the ball. There are no flags on the play. Ruling: Reviewable, re-kick A30. Illegal touching by A1. Only the Replay Official can initiate a review of this play.  A.R. 15.2 Illegal touch before ball goes 10 yards With 6 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, on an onside kick attempt from the A35, the ball is touched first: (a) by A2 at the A40 and then is recovered by A3 at the A45; or (b) by B2 at the A40 and then is recovered by A3 at the A45. Officials award the ball to Team A at A45. Rulings: (a) Reviewable. B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A40, illegal touching by A2. (b) Reviewable. A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on A45. Only the Replay Official can initiate a review of these plays because the kicking team was awarded possession at the end of a free kick down.  A.R. 15.3 Legal touching of onside kick Team A attempts an onside kick from the A35. A1 has his feet at the A44 when he picks up the ball that is on the ground at the A46. Officials rule illegal touching. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on A46. No foul because the ball was touched after it reached B\u2019s restraining line. This play would need to be challenged by a head coach if it occurred before the two-minute warning, because on-field officials did not rule a legal recovery by the kicking team.  FREE KICK OUT OF BOUNDS A.R. 15.4 Kick touched before going out of bounds On a kickoff to start the game, the ball is rolling loose at the B12-yard line. The ball rolls out of bounds at the B10-yard line after touching B1\u2019s foot. Officials rule kickoff out of bounds. Ruling: Reviewable, B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B10. Touching of a kick.  A.R. 15.5 Kick not touched in field of play\u2014Kickoff out of bounds Team A kicks off and the ball goes between the legs of kick returner B3 without touching him and out of bounds at the B5-yard line. Officials rule the ball touched B3 and spot the ball at the B5. Ruling: Reviewable, B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B40. Kickoff out of bounds. Reset game clock to the time of the kickoff.  A.R. 15.6 Player straddling sideline\u2014Kickoff out of bounds Team A kicks off and the airborne ball comes down near the sideline at the B5-yard line where B9 catches it with one foot on the sideline and another in the field of play. Officials rule that B9 was inbounds when he touched the ball and spot it at the B5. Ruling: Reviewable, B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B40. Kickoff out of bounds. Reset game clock to the time of the kickoff.   A.R. 15.7 Ball touching pylon Team A kicks off and the ball hits the outside edge of the goal line pylon and then goes out of bounds.

The spot where an airborne kick crosses the sideline is not reviewable.   A.R. 15.38  Blocking into a kicked ball Fourth-and-8 on A33. A\u2019s punt is rolling at the B31 where A1 blocks passive player B1 into the ball. A2 picks up the ball and the officials award possession to A. Ruling: Not reviewable. While touching of a kick is reviewable, being blocked into a kicked ball is not. Replay can review the touch by B and possession by A.  A.R. 15.39  Fair catch interference  Fourth-and-18 on A40. B1 signals for a fair catch, but is contacted by A1 before he can catch the ball. The ball bounces off B1 to the B35. A1 recovers the ball there and the officials award Team A possession with no flags on the play.  Ruling: Not reviewable. The action that creates a foul for fair catch interference or interference with the opportunity is not reviewable. The only reviewable aspect of this play is whether B1 touched the ball and whether A1 recovered it.  A.R. 15.40 Invalid fair catch signal Fourth-and-5 on A35. On a punted ball B1, who is standing at the B30-yard line, extends his right arm straight up in the air for a second and brings it back down. B1 is awarded with a valid fair catch.  Ruling: Not reviewable. Fair catch signal is not reviewable.  A.R. 15.41 Advance by fair catch signaler Fourth-and-7 on A35. B1 signals for a fair catch. The ball hits the ground and bounces to B1 who scores a TD.  Ruling: Not reviewable. A fair catch signal is not reviewable.   RUNNING PLAYS On running plays, replay can review whether a player advanced the ball across the line to gain or the goal line. This is reviewable in the field of play and at the sideline. Following a line to gain review, the ball will be placed at the correct dead-ball spot, but the challenge will be successful only if the line to gain ruling is changed.  The next situation involves a player allowed to advance by the officials because he is ruled not down by contact or not out of bounds. Replay can review whether the player should have been down by contact or out of bounds before the advance. If the officials put the player down or out of bounds, replay can only review the position of the ball in relation to the line to gain or the goal line, and can award a TD or fumble (with clear recovery) that occurs before the runner takes two additional steps after he had been ruled to touch out of bounds. If a player was falling or being tackled and officials erroneously rule the player down by contact at the start of the fall or tackle, replay can place the ball at the correct down-by-contact spot, provided the player did not regain his balance and continue to run.  If on-field officials rule forward progress, then replay can only review the position of the ball in relation to the line to gain or goal line and can rule that there is a fumble (with clear recovery) if possession is lost prior to or simultaneously with the defensive contact. If the line to gain or goal line is not involved, the spot of forward progress is not reviewable. Replay cannot review whether a runner\u2019s forward progress should have been ruled as stopped or whether a runner gave himself up.  If a runner\u2019s helmet comes off during the play, this is treated the same as down by contact. Replay can review the position of the ball in relation to the line to gain or the goal line when the runner\u2019s helmet came completely off his head.

If Team A challenged the line to gain ruling, the ball would be placed at the B42, and the challenge would be unsuccessful.  FUMBLES (LOOSE BALLS) There are several situations involving fumbles that are reviewable. The most frequent is whether a runner fumbled or was down by contact. If the ruling on the field is a fumble, then replay can determine whether the runner was down by contact, out of bounds, or that his helmet came completely off before he lost possession. Replay cannot rule on whether a runner\u2019s forward progress was stopped before the fumble.  If a runner is ruled down or out of bounds, but he really fumbled the ball, there must be a clear recovery in the continuing action after the fumble to give the ball to the recovering team. If on-field officials make a preliminary ruling of which team recovered the ball, that preliminary ruling constitutes a clear recovery. If there is no clear recovery, but the ball clearly is recovered in the end zone of the team that fumbled the ball, it is a safety.  Replay can also review whether a loose ball touched a boundary line, or anything on a boundary line, including the pylon. If there is no video evidence as to which player recovered the loose ball, the ruling on the field stands.  FUMBLES A.R. 15.57 Runner down before fumble First-and-10 on A20.

A.R. 15.58 Runner not down, back of hand or wrist touches First-and-10 on A20. A2 takes a handoff and runs to the A25 where he is hit by a defender and loses the ball and B1 recovers. Officials rule fumble and give possession to B. The back of A2\u2019s hand and wrist touched the ground before he lost control of it. Ruling: Reviewable. B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on A25. Any part of the hand or wrist does not put a player down. Any part of the arm above the wrist will put a player down. The same holds true for the foot or the ankle.

QBA1 drops back to pass, is hit at the B27 where he loses the ball. A2 catches the ball in mid-air at the B25 and runs to the B5. Officials rule the play a pass, but replays show that A1 lost the ball before his arm started moving forward. Ruling: B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B27, reset the clock to the time when A2 caught the ball. Reversal creates fourth-down fumble administration.  A.R. 15.92 Fumble forward out of bounds First-and-10 on B20. A1 runs to the B18-yard line and fumbles. B2 recovers at the B15-yard line where the officials award Team B possession. Replays show that B2 had his foot on the sideline when recovering the ball. Ruling: A\u2019s ball second-and-8 on B18, reset clock to the time when B2 recovered the ball. Reversal creates fumble forward out of bounds administration. Only the Replay Official can initiate a review of this play.  PASSING PLAYS      Whether a pass is complete or incomplete is always reviewable. This includes in the field of play, at a sideline, and in an end zone.  To complete a catch, there are three primary requirements that must be met. First, the player must gain a firm grip and control of the ball. Second, he must get two feet or another part of his body, other than his hands, on the ground inbounds. And, after these first two requirements have been met, he must perform an act common to the game or maintain control of the ball long enough to do so. If the player does not complete all three of the requirements, the pass is incomplete. These guidelines apply both on the field and in replay.  PASSES IN FIELD OF PLAY A.R. 15.93 Process complete Third-and-5 on A30. Pass over the middle to the B45 is ruled incomplete. Replay shows that receiver A2 had his hands under the ball and it never hit the ground. Ruling: Reviewable. Pass is complete, A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B45. Wind clock on ready.   A.R. 15.94 Does not complete process Third-and-5 on A30. Pass over middle is ruled complete at the B45. Replays show that the ball hit the ground before the receiver gained control. Ruling: Reviewable. Incomplete pass. A\u2019s ball fourth-and-5 on A30. Reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground.   A.R. 15.95 No advance allowed Third-and-10 on 50. Pass to the B30-yard line is close to the ground as defender B1 attempts to intercept it. B1 knocks the ball into the air, A2 catches it and runs for a touchdown, but the Back Judge comes in and rules the pass incomplete. Replays show that the ball never hit the ground. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B30. Reset the clock to the time when A2 caught the ball, and wind clock on the ready-for-play. In this situation, the ball is dead where A2 gained possession, and no advance can be given.  A.R. 15.96 Pass Complete at goal line Second-and-5 on B15. A1 throws a pass to A2, who catches the ball at the B3 and dives into the end zone while being tackled by B1. Officials rule that A2\u2019s foot touched out of bounds and rule an incomplete pass. Team A challenges the ruling. Replays show that A2 controlled the ball with two feet inbounds at the B3-yard line and stretched the ball over the goal line while diving before being down by contact. Ruling: Reviewable. Touchdown A. Reset the clock to the time when the ball crossed the goal line.

QBA1 throws a pass to A2 at the A35 near the sideline. A2 gains control of the ball and gets two feet down in bounds, but does not perform an act common to the game as he falls to the ground out of bounds. A2 momentarily loses control of the ball when he hits the ground out of bounds. He regains control before the ball touches the ground. Officials rule complete.  Ruling: Reviewable. Incomplete Pass. A\u2019s ball second-and-10 on A20. Adjust clock if wound before review. Receiver did not complete all elements of the catch, so he must maintain control of the ball through his contact with the ground. If he is touching the sideline, any loss of control during the process of the catch makes the pass incomplete.   A.R. 15.110 Defender out of bounds First-and-10 on A20. QBA1 throws a pass to A2 near the sideline at the A35. A2 and B2 jump up to catch the pass, A2 comes down inbounds, but B2\u2019s left foot hits the sideline before the rest of his body lands in bounds. Officials rule an incomplete pass. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on A35. Because A2 completed the process of the catch inbounds and was in control of the ball when B2 touched the sideline, this is a completed pass.

QBA1 scrambles to the A17 where he is hit by B3 and stumbles as he releases a pass that falls incomplete at the A30. The Referee rules that the A1\u2019s left knee was down before he released the ball. Replays show that he was still up when he threw the pass. Ruling: Not reviewable. A\u2019s ball second-and-13 on A17. When a player is ruled down by contact, replay cannot make it a pass (forward or backward).  A.R. 15.112 Out of bounds First-and-10 on A20. QBA1 scrambles near the sideline to the A17 and throws a pass that is caught by A2 at the A30. The Referee rules that the QB\u2019s left foot was out of bounds before he released the ball. Replays show that his foot was not out of bounds. Ruling: Not reviewable. A\u2019s ball second-and-13 on A17. On this type of play, when a player is ruled out of bounds, replay cannot make it a pass (forward or backward).   PASS COMPLETE/FUMBLE OR INCOMPLETE Replay can review whether a pass was complete followed by a fumble, or instead, the receiver did not gain possession of the ball and it should be incomplete.   If a player has firm control of the ball with two feet or another body part (other than his hands) touching down inbounds, and then performs an act common to the game before losing it, it is a catch and fumble. If the receiver loses the ball simultaneously or near simultaneously with the second foot coming down (bang-bang), the pass is incomplete.  When a pass is ruled incomplete, either team can challenge that it was a catch and fumble and that they gained possession of the ball. If replays show that it was a catch and fumble, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. If on-field officials make a preliminary ruling of which team recovered the ball, that preliminary ruling constitutes a clear recovery. If there is no clear recovery, the ball will be awarded to the team last in possession at the spot where possession was lost. On fourth down or after the two-minute warning, the ball will be brought back to the spot of the fumble if recovered beyond it by a teammate of the fumbling player.

The loose ball is not recovered by any player. Officials rule the pass incomplete. Ruling: Reviewable, A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on A40, wind clock. There is no clear recovery, so the ball is awarded to Team A at the spot where possession was lost.  PASSES IN END ZONE  The rules regarding whether a pass is complete or incomplete in the field of play also apply to the end zone. The only difference is that a player cannot catch and fumble the ball in his opponent\u2019s end zone, since the play is over once he completes the catch.   ACT COMMON TO THE GAME A.R 15.119 Performs an act common to the game First-and-goal on B5. A1 clearly controls a pass in the end zone with both hands above his head, gets two feet completely down and tucks the ball under his arm before B3 knocks it loose. Officials rule the pass incomplete.  Ruling: Reviewable. Touchdown. Reset the clock to the time when A1 caught the ball.

Reset the clock to the time when A2 completed the catch.  A.R. 15.126 Continuous control after contact Third-and-goal on B5. Airborne receiver A2 controls a pass in the end zone where he gets contacted by a defender and driven back into the field of play where he falls to the ground. When A2 got hit, he lost control of the ball and did not regain it until he landed on the ground at the B1. Replays show that the ball did not hit the ground. Officials rule TD.  Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball fourth-and-goal on B1. Reset the clock to the time when A2 was down by contact, and wind the clock on the ready-for-play. The receiver must maintain continuous control after the contact in order to be awarded a score in this situation. If the ball hit the ground while loose, it would be an incomplete pass if the receiver did not complete the elements of a catch. Only the Replay Official can initiate a review of this play.   A.R. 15.127 No forward progress Third-and-goal on B5. Airborne receiver A2 controls a pass in the end zone and comes back into the field of play, untouched by a defender, where he lands and is tackled at the B2-yard line. Officials rule TD. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball fourth-and-goal on B2. Reset the clock to the time when A2 was down by contact, and wind the clock on the ready-for-play. Since the receiver was airborne and came back into the field of play on his own, he must get the ball back into the end zone for it to be a TD. If he got two feet down in the end zone with control and the ball breaking the plane of the goal line, then it would be a touchdown even though he completed the process of the catch in the field of play. Only the Replay Official can initiate a review of this play.   QB PASS OR FUMBLE Replay can always review whether a player threw a forward pass or fumbled. If the passer\u2019s hand comes forward in an obvious forward passing motion with control of the ball, it is considered a forward pass until he begins to bring the ball back toward his body. Once he starts to bring the ball back to his body, any subsequent loss of control is a fumble.  If there is a fumble that is ruled an incomplete pass, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. If on-field officials make a preliminary ruling of which team recovered the ball, that preliminary ruling constitutes a clear recovery. If there is no clear recovery, the ball will be awarded to the team last in possession at the spot where possession was lost, except that if possession was lost in the team\u2019s own end zone, and the ball was not clearly recovered in the end zone, the ball will be placed at the one-yard line. No advance will be given. If a fumble in the end zone occurs on fourth down or after the two-minute warning, it would be a safety even if recovered in the field of play if the fumbling player clearly did not recover the ball.  HAND COMING FORWARD A.R. 15.128 Hand coming forward with control First-and-10 on A20. QBA1 is hit while passing and loses the ball. B1 recovers the ball and returns it for a touchdown.

A\u2019s ball third-and-18 on A2. Because there is no clear recovery, Team A is awarded the ball at the spot where possession was lost. Team B is not charged a timeout.  PASSING MOTION A.R. 15.132 No forward passing motion Second-and-10 on A20. QBA1 is under pressure, and he brings the ball up towards his head to avoid a defender. He gets hit and the impact causes his hand to go forward, and he loses the ball and B recovers at the A17. Officials rule fumble. Ruling: Reviewable, B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on A17. The QB was not attempting to pass when he lost the ball, so it is a fumble regardless of whether his hand went forward or not. Only the Replay Official can initiate a review of this play.   CANNOT CREATE FOUL AFTER REVERSAL A.R. 15.133 Intentional grounding Second-and-10 on A20. QBA1 who is standing in the pocket at the A15 throws the ball into the ground at the A23 to avoid a sack. There are no eligible receivers in the area where the ball hit the ground. The Referee rules fumble and B3 recovers the ball.  Ruling: Reviewable, A\u2019s ball third-and-10 on A20, reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground. This is an incomplete pass, but replay cannot create a foul for intentional grounding. The only way a foul for intentional grounding can be enforced in this situation is if the Referee threw his flag and picked it up, or before the review made an announcement that grounding would be enforced if the fumble ruling is reversed to an incomplete pass. Only the Replay Official can initiate a review of this play.   QB SPIKE TO CONSERVE TIME A.R. 15.134 QB spike  First-and-10 on B33. After completing a pass in the field of play, Team A lines up and QBA1 attempts to spike the ball to stop the  clock. He loses control of the ball before his hand comes forward and it hits the ground where B7 recovers it. The Referee rules  incomplete pass. Ruling: Reviewable. B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B33. Replay can award possession to the recovering team in this situation. If there is no clear recovery, Team A is awarded the ball at the spot of the fumble and there would be a 10-second runoff if the snap happened after the two-minute warning. On an attempted QB spike, replay can review whether it was a pass or a fumble, but cannot review whether the pass was forward or backward.  FORWARD/BACKWARD PASSES, ILLEGAL FORWARD PASSES, AND HANDOFFS  All illegal forward passes and handoffs are reviewable. Whether a pass is forward or backward is always reviewable. A pass is forward if it first touches the ground, or anything else, at a point that is nearer the opponent\u2019s goal line than the point where the ball leaves the passer\u2019s hand. If it is parallel, it is a backward pass. Also, if the quarterback begins his throwing motion and then is hit by a defender, it is considered a forward pass if he passes the ball, even if the ball goes backward.  If a backward pass is ruled forward and incomplete on the field, after review, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. If on-field officials make a preliminary ruling of which team recovered the ball, that preliminary ruling constitutes a clear recovery. If there is no clear recovery, the ball will be awarded to the team last in possession at the spot where possession was lost. If the ball goes out of bounds through an end zone, it is either a touchback or a safety. If there is no clear recovery, but the ball clearly is recovered in the end zone of the team that threw the backward pass, it is a safety.   FORWARD/BACKWARD PASS A.R. 15.135 Backward pass, clear recovery First-and-10 on A20. QBA1 throws a pass from the A15-yard line that is ruled forward and incomplete. B7 thinking the pass was backward, falls on the loose ball at the A14. Replays show the pass was backward, hitting the ground at the A14. Ruling: Reviewable. B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on A14.

QBA1 throws a pass from the A15-yard line that is ruled forward and incomplete. After hitting the ground, the ball goes out of bounds at the A12-yard line. Replays show the pass was backward, hitting the ground at the A14-yard line. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball second-and-18 on A12, wind clock on ready. In this situation, the ball will be placed at the out of bounds spot. The ball going out of bounds is a clear recovery.   A.R. 15.139 Backward pass out of bounds, safety First-and-10 on A5. QBA1 throws a pass from the A3-yard line that is ruled forward and incomplete. After hitting the ground, the ball hit the goal line pylon. Replays show the pass was backward, hitting the ground at the A1. Ruling: Reviewable. Safety, safety kick A20.  A.R. 15.140 Incomplete forward pass Second-and-10 on A40. QBA1 throws a pass from the A35 toward the sideline. It hits the ground at the A36 and is recovered by B56. The Line Judge rules the pass backward.

QBA1 who is in the pocket and under pressure at the B44 throws the ball towards the sideline and it hits the ground at the B43 and then goes out of bounds. There was no eligible receiver in the area when it hit the ground. The Line Judge rules the pass backward. Team A challenges that the pass was forward. Ruling: Reviewable, A\u2019s ball third-and-10 on B37. Reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground. In this situation, replay can overturn the ruling to a forward pass, but cannot create a foul for intentional grounding. If officials had thrown a flag initially for intentional grounding and then picked it up because of the LJ\u2019s ruling, then replay can put the flag back down, or if the Referee made an announcement regarding grounding before the review, the foul would be enforced after the reversal.   A.R. 15.142 Reversal negates foul First-and-10 on A20. QBA1 throws a swing pass to back A2 at the A18 who runs out of bounds at the A26. Officials rule the pass forward and call tight end A3 for pass interference as he was blocking downfield before the pass was caught. Replays show that the pass was backward. Ruling: Reviewable, A\u2019s ball second-and-4 on A26. Since the pass was backward, there is no foul for pass interference. This would also apply to a foul called for an ineligible player illegally downfield.   A.R. 15.143 Throwing motion affected First-and-10 on A20. QBA1 is under pressure at the A17 and attempts to throw a forward pass to A2 near the sideline at the A24. He starts his throwing motion but is then contacted by B77 before passing the ball. The ball lands at the A14 where B99 falls on it. The Referee rules incomplete pass.  Ruling: Reviewable, A\u2019s ball second-and-10 on A20. If the quarterback begins his throwing motion and is then contacted by a defender, causing the pass to go backward, it is still a forward pass.  ILLEGAL FORWARD PASS A.R. 15.144 Passer beyond the line of scrimmage First-and-10 on B20. QBA1 scrambles and throws a pass from the B19 that is caught by receiver A8 for a touchdown.  Ruling: Reviewable. Illegal forward pass. A\u2019s ball second-and-14 on B24.

Officials call A6 for illegal touching. Ruling: Reviewable, A\u2019s ball first-and-15 on A15. Replay can only review whether the player touched it or not, and cannot look at whether there was intent to touch. The Referee should explain this to the coach if he wants to challenge the ruling.  A.R. 15.152 T-Formation QB First-and-10 on A20. T-formation QBA1 receives the snap and pitches back to A2. A2 runs to his right and throws a forward pass to A1 who catches it and runs for a TD. Ruling: Reviewable. Illegal touching of a forward pass. A\u2019s ball first-and-15 on A15. T-formation QB (under center) is always ineligible. Whether a QB was in T-formation for purposes of eligibility is reviewable regardless of whether a foul was ruled on the field.

TOUCHING OF PASS BY DEFENSIVE PLAYER A.R. 15.158 Defensive pass interference Third-and-10 on A30. Pass to A2 is incomplete, but B1 is called for defensive pass interference at the A40. Replays show the pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage by B2 before the interference. Ruling: Reviewable. No foul. A\u2019s ball fourth-and-10 on A30. For the foul to be negated, the ball must be touched before the interference and by a player away from the action that creates the foul.   A.R. 15.159 Foul occurs before touch First-and-10 on A20. QBA1 throws a pass to A2 at the A35. The BJ rules DPI, but the flag is picked up because the officials rule the ball was touched by B at the line of scrimmage before the foul.

After stepping out of bounds at the A38 and immediately re-establishing, wide receiver A1 catches a pass at the 50 and runs for a touchdown. Officials penalize A for illegal touching of a forward pass. Replays show that A1 was illegally chucked out of bounds beyond 5 yards.  Ruling: Not reviewable. Illegal contact is not reviewable. A\u2019s ball second-and-10 on A20. The only thing replay can review on this play is whether the receiver stepped out and re-established before he touched the pass.   A.R. 15.162 Illegal bat Second-and-10 on A47. A1 leaps high in the air at the B40 and grabs the pass. Before A1\u2019s feet touch the ground, he pitches the ball forward to A2 at the B38-yard line. A2 runs for a touchdown. Ruling: Not reviewable. An illegal bat is not reviewable, even in the end zone.  SCORING PLAYS Replay can review the status of the ball in relation to the goal line, going in or coming out. This includes where a fumble occurs in relation to the goal line. Replay can also review recovery of a loose ball and simultaneous possession in the field of play and in the end zone.   The Replay Official is responsible for initiating a replay review on all plays that result in a score, or where a score was nullified by a penalty. This will apply throughout the entire game and replay is responsible for looking at all reviewable aspects of the play.   GOAL LINE A.R. 15.163 Down by contact Third-and-goal on B1. A1 dives over the goal line, but is ruled down short by the officials. Replays show A1 extending the ball beyond the goal line before being down. Ruling: Reviewable. Touchdown.

There must be a clear recovery by the defense in order to reverse to a touchback. The ball will be placed at the spot of the recovery and here that results in a touchback. If there is no clear recovery or there is a long delay with players stopping before the ball is recovered, then the offense retains possession (unless it was fourth down and the fumble occurred before the line to gain) and the ball will be placed at the spot of the fumble.

Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on A2. Reset the clock to the time when A2 recovered the ball. This is treated the same way as a fumble at the goal line.

Runner A2 takes a handoff and runs down the sideline towards the end zone. He steps near the sideline at the 8-yard line with his left foot and then continues running and crosses the goal line. Officials rule A2 out of bounds at the B8-yard line. Replays show that A2\u2019s left foot did not touch the sideline. Ruling: Not reviewable. A\u2019s ball first-and-goal on B8. In this situation, once the officials rule the player out of bounds, replay can only look at the position of the ball in relation to the line to gain or goal line at that point.

In order to be reviewable, the ball must cross below the top of the uprights.  A.R. 15.188 Player takes ball into end zone  Fourth-and-10 on B45. A1 punts and B1 receives the punt at the B2, starts to run to avoid a tackler and takes the ball into his own end zone where he is tackled. Officials rule safety. Ruling: Not reviewable. The officials\u2019 ruling on the field that the player took the ball into his own end zone (not momentum) is not reviewable. If the player had completed the catch in the end zone, the play would be reviewable.  ILLEGAL BAT A.R. 15.189 Illegal Bat First-and-10 on A3. A2 runs to the A5 and fumbles. B3 then bats the loose ball through A\u2019s end zone and over the end line. Officials rule safety. Ruling: Not reviewable. Safety, SK A20. An illegal bat is not reviewable, even if it results in a score or occurs in the end zone.  TIMING The game clock is reviewable, and time can be put back on the clock in certain situations. If the clock operator incorrectly starts the game clock, replay can fix the error, provided the correction occurs before the next legal snap or kick.   At the end of either half, if there is visual evidence of a down ending with two or more seconds remaining, but time expires on the game clock, it can be reset through a replay review. In the first half the score is not a factor, but the Replay Official will have some discretion based on the field position of the next snap. The offensive team\u2019s 40-yard line will be a general guideline. In the 4th quarter the score must be within eight points (one score), and the team that is behind must put the ball in play next (either team if score is tied). The next down must be a snap from scrimmage. The clock will not be reset if the next timed down is a free kick. The game clock can also be reset if there is visual evidence of a game official beginning to signal for a called team timeout with two or more seconds remaining, but time expires on the clock.  Consultation with on-field officials regarding the correct status of the game clock is also permitted as part of the Replay Official\u2019s customary administrative duties.

The clock will not be reset following a replay review when the on-field ruling is not changed.  There are two situations when time can be taken off the game clock following a replay review. (1) For any play that starts after the two-minute warning of either half and the correct ruling would not have stopped the clock, there will be a 10-second runoff from the time the play should have ended. If the correct ruling would have only temporarily stopped the clock (e.g., incomplete changed to catch and fumble out of bounds), there is still a potential 10-second runoff as if the clock would have continued to run.

The Replay Official initiates a review, and it is determined that A3\u2019s second foot came down out of bounds with 0:46 remaining on the clock.  Ruling: Reviewable.

Replays show that A8 did catch the ball with 1:15 left on the clock.  Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B35, adjust game clock to 1:05 and wind. The clock is reset to the time when the pass was complete and then 10 seconds are run off from that point. Team B could use a remaining timeout in lieu of the runoff.

QBA1 completes a pass to receiver A8 who is tackled at the goal line. The officials rule TD and the clock is stopped with 7 seconds remaining. The Replay Official stops the game after a replay comes up that clearly shows A8 was down by contact with the ball at the B1 and 9 seconds on the clock. Ruling: Reviewable. Run 10 seconds off the clock, half over. If Team A had a timeout remaining it could use it in lieu of the runoff, and it would have the ball at the B1 with 9 seconds remaining.

The clock is reset to the time when A2 was down by contact (0:26) and both teams have the option of taking a team timeout to avoid the 10-second runoff. If a timeout is taken, the clock remains at 0:26 and starts on the snap. If neither team takes a timeout, then the clock is set to 0:16 and starts on the ready-for-play.

With 0:04 remaining in the game, Team B leads 16-8, and both teams have one timeout remaining. Back A2 catches a screen pass from QBA1 at the B7 and is running near the sideline when B1, who is out of bounds, strips the ball out of A2\u2019s hands at the B5 with 0:02 on the clock. The ball rolls into the end zone, where B2 recovers the ball for a touchback with 0:00 on the game clock. The Replay Official initiates a review of the play. Ruling: A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-goal on B5. This is a fumble out of bounds at the B5. The game clock will be reset to the time when it became dead out of bounds (0:02). For plays after the two-minute warning, if there is a reversal to a running clock, or to a situation where the clock is re-started, there is a 10-second runoff. Team A can use its last timeout to prevent the runoff.  A.R. 15.219 Line to gain ruling not changed, no clock reset Third-and-10 on A30. With 1:55 remaining in a tied game, A1 runs to the A39, where he is tackled. Officials spot the ball at the A38. Replays show that A1 was down by contact near the A40, and the Replay Official challenges the play. Following review, the Referee re-spots the ball and measures, and the ball is just short of the A40. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball fourth-and-inches on A39. Because the ruling of whether A2 made the line to gain did not change, the clock is not reset and there is no 10-second runoff. The game clock will start on the ready for play, and the play clock will start from the time it was when the game was stopped (minimum of 10 seconds).  NO ADJUSTMENT TO GAME CLOCK A.R. 15.220 Kick touched before going out of bounds  With five seconds left in the fourth quarter, Team A kicks off and the ball glances off the leg of B3 and goes out of bounds at the B5-yard line. Officials rule that the ball did not touch B3 and rule a kickoff out of bounds.  Ruling: Reviewable. B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B5, but in this situation, replay cannot take time off the clock, five seconds remain.   NON-REVIEWABLE PLAYS INVOLVING THE CLOCK A.R. 15.221 Stop or wind Second-and-10 on B45. With 10 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Team A trails 17-14 and is out of timeouts. Receiver A80 catches a pass at the B35 with five seconds on the clock and attempts to get out of bounds. He dives for the sideline and is ruled out with one second left on the clock. Replays show that the first body part to hit the ground was his left knee inbounds at the B35. Ruling: Not reviewable. A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B35 with one second remaining. Whether the game clock should have stopped or not at the end of a down is not reviewable.   A.R. 15.222 Play clock Second-and-10 on B15. With the play clock winding down QBA1 receives the snap and throws a TD pass to A80. Replays show that the play clock expired before the snap.  Ruling: Not reviewable. Touchdown A, KO A35.

If a team takes a timeout to stop a running clock after the two-minute warning and a subsequent replay review results in a reversal to a stopped clock, the timeout is restored.  If a team challenges a ruling that can only be challenged by the Replay Official, it will be charged with a timeout, but not a challenge. The play may still be reviewable by the Replay Official.

With 2:45 to go in the fourth quarter, A2 catches a pass at the A45. Before the next snap, defensive end B7 encroaches and then the Team B coach throws his challenge flag. Team B is out of timeouts.  Ruling: Reviewable, but Team B cannot challenge both because it committed a foul that prevented the snap, and because it is out of timeouts. A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B35. In this situation, the UNS is considered a foul between downs, so both fouls are enforced.   A.R. 15.231 Coach attempts to withdraw challenge First-and-10 on A20.

QBA1\u2019s pass is ruled incomplete at the sideline at the 50. Team A\u2019s coach challenges that the pass was complete. While the Referee was coming to the sideline, a replay on the video board shows the pass was incomplete. The coach then tells the Referee that he doesn\u2019t want to challenge the ruling. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball second-and-10 on A20, charge Team A with a timeout. A coach cannot challenge a reviewable play and then change his mind. If the Referee feels that is the case, the head coach has two choices. He can either go through with the challenge and all normal rules will apply. (If the play stands, the team loses a challenge and a timeout.) Or, the coach can take a team timeout (no challenge charged). If the Referee feels the coach is genuinely confused as to what is reviewable, then the Referee can allow the coach to pick up the red flag with no challenge or timeout charged.   TIMEOUT NOT CHARGED  A.R. 15.232 Aspect of the play changed Fourth-and-10 on A35. A1 punts to B1 at the B25-yard line. B1 returns the punt to the B32, where he is hit and fumbles. A2 recovers the ball at the B34, but is ruled out of bounds and officials award the ball to Team B. Team A challenges that A2 was not touching the sideline during the recovery. Replays show that B1\u2019s knee touched down before the fumble. Ruling: Reviewable. B\u2019s ball first-and-10 on B32. Reset the clock to the time when B1 was down by contact. This is a successful challenge and A will not be charged with a timeout because a reviewable aspect of the play was changed. The only exception to this is when a team challenges the line to gain and the ball is re-spotted, but the down remains the same.  TIMEOUT INSIDE TWO MINUTES A.R. 15.233 Timeout restored; reversal creates stopped clock First-and-10 on A40. With 1:30 remaining in the fourth quarter and Team A trailing 17-14, QBA1 completes a pass to A2 in the middle of the field at the B42 and then calls a timeout. Replays show the pass hitting the ground before A2 possessed it and the Replay Official initiates a review of the play. Ruling: Reviewable. Incomplete pass, A\u2019s ball second-and-10 on A40, reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground. Team A\u2019s timeout is restored. For the timeout to be restored, the timeout must have been taken to stop a running clock after the two-minute warning and there is a reversal to a stopped clock.  A.R. 15.234 Timeout restored; change of possession Second-and-5 on A25.

Team A\u2019s timeout is restored because an injury timeout is not charged on a play involving a change of possession.  A.R. 15.235 Timeout not restored; line to gain Third-and-10 on A40. With 1:52 remaining in the fourth quarter, QBA1 completes a pass to A2 who runs to the 50, where he is tackled. Officials mark the ball just short of the 50 making it fourth down. Team A takes a timeout to decide whether to go for it and a replay comes up showing that the ball was just beyond the 50 when A2 was down by contact. The Replay Official initiates a review of the play.  Ruling: Reviewable, A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on 50, reset clock to the time when A2 was down by contact. Team A\u2019s timeout is not restored because the changed ruling to a first down did not result in a stopped clock. There is no 10-second runoff because a timeout was called after the play.  FOULS THAT PREVENT SNAP If a team commits a foul that prevents the snap, it is no longer permitted to challenge the previous play. A foul is considered to prevent the snap if it is committed after the ball is made ready for play (ball in position to be snapped and officials in position to officiate the play) and causes the play clock to stop before a snap. If the team attempts to challenge, it will be charged a timeout or UNS penalty (if out of timeouts). Fouls that prevent the snap will not prevent the Replay Official from initiating a review that would benefit the offending team. This rule applies to both offensive and defensive fouls. There is nothing a team can do to prevent a review when the Replay Official is responsible for initiating it.   NO REVIEW PERMITTED A.R. 15.236 Team fouls before next snap and challenges First-and-10 on A20. With 8 minutes to go in the third quarter, A2 catches a pass at the A45. Before the next snap, defensive end B7 encroaches. After the encroachment foul, Team B attempts to challenge that the pass was incomplete. Ruling: Reviewable, but since Team B committed a foul that prevented the snap, it cannot challenge the ruling. A\u2019s ball first- and-5 on 50. Team B is charged a timeout, but not a challenge.  REVIEW PERMITTED A.R. 15.237 False start, inside two minutes   First-and-10 on A20. With 1:23 left in the second quarter, QBA1\u2019s pass to A3 is ruled incomplete at the A45. Before the next snap tackle A67 false starts. Replays show that A3 caught the pass. Ruling: Reviewable, A\u2019s ball first-and-10 on A45, the FST is ignored. Reset the clock to the time when A3 caught the pass and either team can elect to use a charged team timeout to avoid a 10-second runoff from that time. When the play falls under the Replay Official\u2019s jurisdiction, a foul that prevents the snap will not prevent a review. The false start is only ignored if the call is overturned.  A.R. 15.238 Defensive foul, offense challenges First-and-10 on B20. In the third quarter, A3 catches a pass at the B3 and gets tackled right at the goal line. The officials rule A3 down short of the goal line. Before the next snap, B77 encroaches. Team A then challenges that A3 scored. Replays show that the ball was breaking the plane of the goal line before A3 was down and that QBA1 was at the B18 when he threw the pass. Ruling: Reviewable. IFP, A\u2019s ball, second-and-13 on B23, the ENC is ignored. Reset the clock to the time when the ball broke the plane of the goal line and start on the snap.

B1 intercepts a pass and returns it for a touchdown. Before the snap, B had 12 players in the formation, but no foul was called, and the snap was allowed.  Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball third-and-5 on B17. Replay can review the number of players on the field at the snap even though officials did not call a foul for too many men in formation. If this foul is created in replay it is enforced as a live ball foul. Only the Replay Official can initiate a review of this play.   A.R. 15.241 Too many men in the formation, play shut down before snap Second-and-10 on B40. The Side Judge shuts the play down just before the snap, ruling that Team B had 12 players in the formation, but there were only 11 players in the formation. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball second-and-10 on B40. The number of players on the field when officials rule a dead-ball foul for too many players in formation is reviewable.  A.R. 15.242 Players on the field at the snap\u2014Illegal substitution Third-and-5 on A35. A1 takes a handoff and runs to the A38, where he is tackled by B1. Officials rule that B11, who came off the bench at the A40 as the eleventh player, entered the field after the snap and throw a flag for illegal substitution. Replays show that B11 had touched the ground with both feet in the field of play before the snap. Team B challenges the play. Ruling: Reviewable play. A\u2019s ball, fourth-and-2 on A38. Whether a player was on the field at the snap is reviewable and can create or remove a foul for illegal substitution.   ADMINISTRATION A.R. 15.243 Spot of foul Third-and-10 on B20. QBA1 is under pressure and throws an incomplete pass while standing at the B38. The Referee calls intentional grounding and after enforcing the penalty, the ball is placed at the B32. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball fourth-and-28 on B38.   A.R. 15.244 Spot of foul, pass interference at line of scrimmage Second-and-10 on B18. QBA1 throws a short pass to A2 at the B18, which falls incomplete. While the ball is in the air, defender B1 grabs and turns A2 at the B18. Thinking the foul was at the B16, officials throw a flag for DPI and enforce it at that spot, first-and-10 on B16. Team B\u2019s head coach challenges the spot of the foul. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball third-and-10 on B18; no DPI; and reset the clock to the time it was when the ball hit the ground. The spot of a foul is reviewable, and since the action that was called DPI was not more than a yard beyond the line of scrimmage, it cannot be a foul for DPI. If the Referee had announced before the review that there was both DH and DPI on the play, the offense would have the option to accept the DH following review.    A.R. 15.245 Number of down after penalty enforcement Third-and-6 on A35. B1 is offside. The penalty is accepted. Officials mark off the penalty, but mistakenly make it fourth down. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball third-and-1 on A40. Replay can be used to determine the proper down.  A.R. 15.246 Penalty yardage First-and-10 on B35. A1 completes a forward pass to the B12-yard line, but A2 is called for holding. The officials mistakenly mark off a five-yard penalty. Ruling: Reviewable. A\u2019s ball first-and-20 on B45. Replay can be used to determine the yardage penalty.  A.R. 15.247 Timing of Foul Third-and-8 on A32. A1 throws a pass that is intercepted by B1 at the A40 and returned to the A25, where he is tackled.

QBA1 rolls out of the pocket to avoid a sack and throws the ball from the end zone to the A10 with no eligible receivers in the area.

B12 comes off the bench and makes a block that allows B1 to run for a score. Ruling: Not reviewable. A palpably unfair act is not a reviewable infraction. Whether a player was on the field at the snap is reviewable and can create or remove a foul for illegal substitution.

The Replay Official is not responsible for initiating a review during a free kick before the two-minute warning, but is responsible for challenging the play if there is a turnover or score during a subsequent run.  TIMING OF CHALLENGE A.R. 15.262 Double Challenge Second-and-10 on B35. With 12:00 remaining in the fourth quarter, QBA1 rolls out and throws a pass to A2 at the back of the end zone that is ruled incomplete. Team A challenges that the pass was complete, but replays show that A2 only got one foot down inbounds and the call on the field is upheld. While the Referee is making his announcement, a new replay comes up that shows the QB stepping on the sideline at the B40 before releasing the pass. Team B challenges the play. Ruling: Reviewable. Both teams can challenge the same play. A\u2019s ball third-and-15 on the B40, reset the clock to the time when the QB stepped out of bounds, and start on the snap. A team cannot challenge the same play twice. It is important that all reviewable aspects of a play are confirmed by replay regardless of what is being challenged. Team A is charged with a challenge and a timeout.  A.R. 15.263 Next legal snap First-and-10 on A20. In the third quarter, A2 catches a pass at the A45. Before the next snap, Tackle A5 false starts. Replays show that the ball hit the ground before A2 caught it. Ruling: Reviewable. Play can be reviewed up until the next legal snap. Incomplete pass, A\u2019s ball second-and 10 on A20, reset the clock to the time the ball hit the ground, and the penalty for false start is ignored. Only Team B can challenge the ruling in this situation since it did not commit the foul that prevented the next snap.  A.R. 15.264 Try First-and-10 on B15. At the start of the play there is 2:02 remaining in the second quarter. A2 catches a pass in the end zone that is ruled a TD with 1:53 left on the clock. Team A then attempts a two-point conversion and QBA1 is ruled down short of the goal line. Replays show that the ball broke the plane before he was down.  Ruling: Reviewable, two-point conversion is good, KO A35. Only the Replay Official can initiate a review of a Try, whether successful or unsuccessful.  A.R. 15.265 Double foul that prevents the snap First-and-10 on B30. A pass to A2 is ruled incomplete near the goal line. Before the next legal snap, A5 commits a false start and B1 commits a personal foul when he forcibly shoves A5 to the ground. Replays show that A2 caught the pass.  Ruling: The ruling of incomplete pass is not reviewable. A\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B15. Although Team A\u2019s foul is disregarded as part of the 5-15 penalty enforcement, both teams committed a foul that prevented a snap, so neither team can challenge the previous play.  PENALTY ENFORCEMENT AFTER REVERSAL A.R. 15.266 UNR/UNS enforcement First-and-10 on A30. QBA1 throws a low pass that is ruled intercepted by B2 at the A43-yard line. B2 returns the ball to the A10-yard line where he is tackled by the facemask by A3. Replays show that the ball hit the ground before B2 intercepted it. Ruling: Reviewable.
